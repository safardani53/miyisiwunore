Alves' ludicrous wage - which he can probably scrape by on thanks to a few decent earners in the past - has left us wondering who the worst-paid players are at each of the 20 Premier League clubs."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

He has already featured in seven of Arsenal's 11 Prem games so far this season.</p><h2>Aston Villa - Jacob Ramsey (£15,000 per-week)</h2><p>Young midfielder Jacob Ramsey is Aston Villa's worst-paid player at 'just' £15,000 per-week.</p><p>The 20-year-old has already made 10 Prem appearances so far in the 2021-22 campaign.</p><p>He also netted his first Villa goal last month in a 3-1 defeat to Arsenal at the Emirates.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Read More Sun Sport</h2></p><h2>Brentford - Jan Zamburek (£3,150 per-week)</h2><p>Czech midfielder Jan Zamburek is one of the worst-paid players in the Prem at just over £3,000 per-week.</p><p>The 20-year-old featured 23 times for The Bees in the Championship but is yet to make his top flight debut at the club.</p><p>Only Watford have any Prem players in their squad on less per-week than Zamburek.</p><h2>Brighton & Hove Albion - Jakub Moder (£10,000 per-week)</h2><p>Swiss international Jakub Moder is somewhat surprisingly Brighton's worst-paid member of their squad.</p><p>The 22-year-old midfielder joined from Lech Poznan in 2020 and has played 22 times in the Prem for the Seagulls.</p><p>Moder netted his first goal for Brighton back in August as Graham Potter's side beat Cardiff 2-0 in the Carabao Cup.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/315380f4-393a-4c20-ae00-1b139d3176b4.jpg><h2>Burnley - Will Norris (£5,769 per-week)</h2><p>Burnley's reserve keeper Will Norris is the worst-paid player in Sean Dyche's squad.</p><p>The 28-year-old actually featured twice in the Premier League last season when Nick Pope was out with an injury.</p><p>But he has played just three times since arriving in the summer of 2020, so his low wage is probably justified.</p><h2>Chelsea - Marcus Bettinelli (£35,000 per-week)</h2><p>Chelsea keeper Marcus Bettinelli is the worst-paid player at Stamford Bridge, although it is a wage which could easily be one of the highest at other top flight clubs.</p><p>The 29-year-old arrived from Fulham in the summer and has been put straight on £35,000 per-week.</p><p>He has not played a single minute for Chelsea so far as he is behind Edouard Mendy and Kepa Arrizabalaga in the pecking order.</p><h2>Crystal Palace - Remi Matthews (£4,700 per-week)</h2><p>Another player on an incredibly low Premier League wage is Crystal Palace reserve keeper Remi Matthews.</p><p>The 27-year-old arrived from Sunderland in the summer having played just six times in League One last season.</p><p>He has previously played for Plymouth Argyle and Bolton Wanderers but never made a top flight appearance.</p><h2>Everton - Anthony Gordon (£10,000 per-week)</h2><p>One of the few worst-paid players at a Prem club who can actually profess to being a first-team regular.</p><p>Anthony Gordon, 20, has played in each of Everton's last seven league matches, popping up on either flank for Rafa Benitez's men.</p><p>He may be on just £10,000 per-week now, but you imagine that could change in the near future.</p><h2>Leeds United - Jamie Shackleton (£17,000 per-week)</h2><p>Leeds' worst-paid player is 22-year-old midfielder/right-back Jamie Shackleton.</p><p>The homegrown talent has been at Elland Road since he was a young boy and has already appeared 72 times for the club.</p><p>Since being promoted to the Premier League, Shackleton has appeared 21 times in the top flight.</p><h2>Leicester City - Luke Thomas (£25,000 per-week)</h2><p>Luke Thomas broke through towards the end of last season as a viable option for Brendan Rodgers at left-back.</p><p>And his highlight reel moment to date came back in May when he scored a wonderful goal in Leicester's 2-1 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford - the club's first victory there since 1998.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000652742647.jpg><h2>Liverpool - Neco Williams (£9,000 per-week)</h2><p>Liverpool full-back Neco Williams carries the unwanted title of worst-paid player at Anfield.</p><p>The Welsh defender has sporadically come into the team when Trent Alexander-Arnold or Andy Robertson are missing, but ultimately he has failed to establish himself as their deputy.</p><p>And with the emergence of Konstantinos Tsimikas, Williams' opportunities could become even rarer.</p><h2>Manchester City - Liam Delap (£8,000 per-week)</h2><p>The son of former Stoke City player Rory Delap, 18-year-old Liam is currently on a wage of £8,000 per-week.</p><p>He is yet to make his top flight debut but has scored and assisted in his only Premier League 2 games so far this season.</p><h2>Manchester United - Shola Shoretire (£8,000 per-week)</h2><p>Teenager Shola Shoretire signed his first professional contract back in March when he penned an £8,000 per-week deal with Manchester United.</p><p>He then swiftly went on to make his Premier League debut less than a fortnight later in a victory over Newcastle.</p><p>And he then made history the following week as the Red Devils' youngest ever player to feature in a European game, coming on in a goalless draw with Real Sociedad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3d480263-b61b-403a-913c-e15fad8fc1ea.jpg><h2>Newcastle United - Mark Gillespie (£11,538 per-week)</h2><p>Keeper Mark Gillespie is the worst-paid player at St James' Park having joined from Motherwell in 2020.</p><p>He is yet to feature in the Prem, but last season did make three appearances in the Carabao Cup.</p><p>You imagine Newcastle's wage structure will be changing a great deal in the coming years following the Saudi takeover.</p><h2>Norwich City - Bali Mumba (£5,000 per-week)</h2><p>Strugglers Norwich have been criticised for failing to improve their squad since the last time they were in the Premier League.</p><p>But their worst-paid player Bali Mumba does earn more than the lowest-paid players from fellow promoted sides Brentford and Watford, so in that respect the Canaries are not neglecting anybody in the squad when it comes to financial rewards.</p><p>Mumba has only featured once in the Prem this season so is not really at the core of the first team.</p><h2>Southampton - Nathan Tella (£12,000 per-week)</h2><p>Nathan Tella, 22, came through Southampton's superb academy set-up and made 18 Prem appearances last season.</p><p>He also scored his first top flight goal in May in a 3-1 win over Fulham, but his breakthrough campaign did not earn him a pay increase from £12,000 per-week.</p><p>So far this season he last played six times, netting in Saints' 8-0 Carabao Cup win over Newport County.</p><h2>Tottenham Hotspur - Oliver Skipp (£24,000 per-week)</h2><p>One of the most recognised names in this list is Tottenham midfielder Oliver Skipp.</p><p>The England U21 international played 45 times in Norwich's Championship-winning campaign last season before returning to Spurs.</p><p>And he has now established himself as a Premier League regular, starting nine of Tottenham's 11 matches so far.</p><h2>Watford - Jeremy Ngakia (£2,500 per-week)</h2><p>Young right-back Jeremy Ngakia actually played five Prem games for West Ham in the 2019-20 campaign.</p><p>He then joined Watford last season and featured 25 times for them in the Championship.</p><p>But the 21-year-old £2,500 per-week man - who is THE worst-paid player in the Prem - is yet to play for the Hornets since their return to the top flight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000690204719.jpg><h2>West Ham United - Ben Johnson (£19,231 per-week)</h2><p>West Ham full-back Ben Johnson has become a fan-favourite at the London Stadium.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>The 21-year-old played 14 times in the Prem last season and was subsequently named West Ham's Young Player of the Season.</p><p>He has continued to contribute in the 2021-22 campaign, netting the opening goal in the Hammers' 4-1 win over Aston Villa last month.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>BETTING SPECIAL -
