Unlike other gym staples like a treadmill or an exercise bike, a cross trainer works your arms, legs and core – helping you to lose weight, stay in shape and tone your muscles, all at the same time.
Also known as elliptical trainers, there are a number of different factors to consider when buying a cross trainer – including maximum user weight, stride length, how they’re powered and whether you want to be able to connect to interactive training programmes such as iFit."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

A cross trainer could be the way to go.</strong></p><p>Unlike other gym staples like a <a href=#>treadmill</a> or an <a href=#>exercise bike</a>, a cross trainer works your arms, legs and core – helping you to lose weight, stay in shape and tone your muscles, all at the same time.</p><p>Also known as elliptical trainers, there are a number of different factors to consider when buying a cross trainer – including maximum user weight, stride length, how they’re powered and whether you want to be able to connect to interactive training programmes such as iFit.</p><p>Other things to be aware of are flywheel weights (generally, the heavier the better), and how the resistance levels are altered – magnetic set-ups are seen on cheaper models, while more expensive machines use an ‘induction brake system’ that essentially modifies the voltage to increase or decrease resistance.</p><p>Finally, it’s worth bearing in mind the size of a cross trainer. While fold-up machines are available (such as the NordicTrack Space Saver featured below), the majority have a large footprint. Although they are big, they are still a worthwhile investment and are something of an all-in-one home gym.</p><p>Not sure where to start in your search for the best cross trainer? Check out the below to find the right one for your needs.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong></p><h2>Best professional cross trainer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2021-10-21-at-12.43.07-pm.png><ul><li class="title svelte-6ol7zd"><strong>Life Span Commercial Elliptical Trainer E5I+, £1699 from Decathlon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>If you're looking for a professional cross trainer for home, the E5I+ Elliptical is for you.

As the pole travels, you'll see that you'll need to extend your right arm to keep up. Then propel yourself forward with your left foot and left arm. Continue to go forward in this manner. Make sure you use your arms instead of relying just on your legs to get the job done.</li><li>Start slowly, but make a mental note of the difficulty level for next time. Most machines include a resistance setting that may be changed to make the motion more difficult or easier.</li><h2>What muscles does the cross trainer work?</h2><p>Cross trainers are the best low impact cardio-based workouts, that will build up your muscles at the same time. They will target your legs and arms muscles simultaneously, whilst also strengthening your core.</p><p>More specifically, the muscles worked will be hamstrings and quadriceps mostly.</p><h2>Are cross trainers good for weight loss?</h2><p>Yes! If you want a low-impact workout, or to get started on a weight loss journey cross trainers are one of the best &nbsp;ways to do so.</p><p>They can help you burn a lot of extra calories while also strengthening and improving the condition of your heart and lungs.&nbsp;Exercising on a cross trainer is beneficial for getting your heart rate into the weight-loss and fitness zones, without having to do strenuous exercises.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE SUN SELECTS HEALTH AND FITNESS</h2></p><p>Found our round-up of the best cross trainers useful?
