I have always had a soft spot for small Peugeots.</p><p>The love affair goes back to my wet-look-spikey-fringe phase in the late Eighties when I bought a 205 XS.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NINTCHDBPICT000531216567.jpg><p>I couldn’t afford a GTi, so the XS with its lively 1.4 was the next best thing.</p><p>I played a blinder a few years later when I persuaded the wife she needed a white 106 Rallye with white steel wheels.</p><p>What an absolute joy that car was. There is a gap in my back catalogue because kids meant our next motor was a sensible saloon. So I missed out on the 206 GTi and 207 GTi but by all accounts they weren’t anywhere near as good as their forefathers.</p><p>The next spicy hot hatch with a lion on the front was the 208 GTi 30th by <a href=#>Peugeot</a> Sport.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NINTCHDBPICT000531216661.jpg><p>That was an absolute peach. It had a Torsen diff nicked off the RCZ R and banged out 208hp. So I grabbed the keys for the new 208 with much enthusiasm — only to find, like your first girlfriend, it is never quite as good as you first remember. Don’t get me wrong. It looks fantastic — particularly the GT Line with its black wheel arch extensions and rear pillar badging. Obviously a nod to the 205 GTi.</p><p>It will sell like hot sausage rolls on looks alone. And it’s the same story inside.</p><p>The snazzy cabin is a real crowd-pleaser with its 3D iCockpit, 10in touchscreen, piano key switches, carbon trim, and all sorts of driver assistance tech first seen on the 508.</p><p>But it’s a bit of a case of style over substance, if I’m brutally honest. My heart says Yes but my head says, er, maybe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NINTCHDBPICT000531216625.jpg><p>And here’s why. The ride quality isn’t brilliant. It’s a bit jiggly. The boot has shrunk. And Peugeot’s signature small steering wheel doesn’t work in this car — particularly for taller drivers who like to sit low. Like moi. It means you have to set the steering wheel stupidly low or you can’t see the instrument cluster.</p><h2>HEAVY GIRL</h2><p>But the biggest crime comes from the marketing department who priced the top-spec 130hp GT Line at £23,350. What? I criticised the Corsa GSi for being overpriced at 19 grand.</p><p>The GT Line costs more than a Fiesta ST-3, which has got it licked for power and driving thrills. Yes, Peugeot is making nicer cars these days but it needs to keep a lid on premium pricing. Now you can buy a 208 for £16,250 if you really wanted. But you wouldn’t.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Key facts: Peugeot 208 GT Line</h3></p><ul><li>Price: <strong>£23,350</strong></li><li>Engine: <strong>1.2-litre 3cyl turbo petrol</strong></li><li>Power: <strong>130hp</strong></li><li>0-62mph: <strong>8.7 secs</strong></li><li>Top speed: <strong>129mph</strong></li><li>Economy: <strong>46mpg</strong></li><li>CO2: <strong>108g/km</strong></li><li>Out: <strong>January</strong></li></ul><p>That’s the basic 75hp non-turbo Active which is nothing more than a headline ‘208 from £16,000’ figure and best avoided.</p><p>Spend a few quid extra per month on the £18,850 Allure and you’ll unlock decent kit, bigger wheels and the cool lion’s claw LED rear lights.</p><p>Now here’s the really clever bit from Peugeot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NINTCHDBPICT000531216649.jpg><p>You can have a 208 in one of three ways: petrol, diesel or fully electric. Whatever suits you best. The e-208 has a 50kWh battery, 211-mile range, and costs £25,000 after the £3,500 Plug-in Car Grant. It’s also the nippiest of the lot, despite being a heavy girl at 1,455kg.</p><p>Peugeot says the total cost of ownership over four years works out less than petrol and diesel because fuel and maintenance are cheaper. No exhaust, no clutch and so on.</p><p>That may be so. But the reality is that e-208 is still only a second family car for buzzing around town and the school run. The Achilles heel remains charge time and convenience — 7.5 hours with a 7kW home charger, assuming you don’t live on the 36th floor, or 30 minutes for 80 per cent juice at a 100kWh public rapid charger, if you can find one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NINTCHDBPICT000531216656.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in motors</h2></p><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Key facts: Peugeot e-208</h3></p><ul><li>Price:<strong> £25,050</strong></li><li>Battery: <strong>50kWh</strong></li><li>Power: <strong>136hp</strong></li><li>0-62mph: <strong>8.1 secs</strong></li><li>Top speed:<strong> 93mph</strong></li><li>Range: <strong>211 miles</strong></li><li>CO2:<strong> 0g/km</strong></li><li>Out: <strong>March</strong></li></ul><p>So is the GTi dead? Maybe not. Will it return as a battery-powered 208? Let’s hope so. GTi is part of Peugeot’s DNA. People know what it means.</p><p>Porsche kept Turbo and Turbo S with the Taycan and electric cars don’t have a turbo.<br>A Peugeot engineer told me: “If we do it, it must have a high level of sensation. We won’t just do it to continue the story.”</p><p>Excellent. I’ll have one. If I can afford it.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">2020 Yaris</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/unnamed-file.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>THREE cars often spotted outside Gala and the village bowls club: Honda Jazz, Hyundai i10, Toyota Yaris. Why? Because they are good, sensible cars for old people.</p><p>But the thing is, I reckon this new Yaris will catch the eye of younger people who don’t have a perm and fish supper every Friday. It looks tidy.</p><p>It’s the first small Toyota to be built on a new platform that radically improves pretty much everything really: dynamics, safety and design. The end result is a car with a lower centre of gravity, stiffer body, longer wheel-base and bags more style. I can’t wait to see next hot Yaris GRMN.</p><p>And of course, being a Toyota, it will be powered by a new 1.5-litre three-cylinder petrol hybrid that’s more powerful, more fuel efficient and cleaner.</p><p>On sale next summer, prices around £15,000.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxyfJBuaW1qYGS9psHGnqatZWJlhW6z02ajoqaVYra0ecBmmaKsXaSzbq2MnJisnV2ks26%2F07KjnmWfq7KzedKumayskaOwpns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kaia-gerber-20010903-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kaia Gerber (Model) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
