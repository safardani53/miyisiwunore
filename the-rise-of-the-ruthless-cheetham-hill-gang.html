The house he grew up in had a shrine to Bennett, whose <a href=#>body was never recovered from the moors</a>.</p><p>While his grandmother was consumed with grief Tony set about making a name for himself as a gangster.</p><p>The Cheetham Hill crew liked his bravado and soon gave him a job driving a gang leader around in a top of the range Cosworth.</p><p>He was also at the front of the Hillbillies war with Moss Side, and was reported to be a suspect in the murder of Anthony 'Scratch' Gardner.</p><p>Johnson was a gangster during the so called Madchester era when nightclubs like the <a href=#>Hacienda</a> attracted footballers and popstars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2eaf5a48-fbda-4383-aebc-ae636875a83f.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/desmond-noonan-seen-shortly-released-792149664.jpg><p>Johnson was known for swaggering into nightclubs carrying a gun, threatening to kill doormen and refusing to pay admission fees.</p><p>But two months after Johnson is said to have taken part in an armed robbery in Oldham when gunmen stole hundreds of thousands of pounds, he was shot dead outside a Cheetham Hill pub.</p><p>South Manchester gang boss Dessie Noonan was one of several men charged with murder, but the prosecution fell apart at Manchester Crown Court.</p><p><strong>Blood brothers</strong></p><p>The Adetero brothers were a major force within the Cheethall Hill crime gang in the 90s.</p><p>David and Ade Adetero formed a robbery gang with a group of lads that had grown up with . It was a tight knit crew that did not trust outsiders.</p><p>The blaggers managed to pull off an astonishing 14 robberies in just two years across the north west.</p><p>In December 1996 they were caught on camera dragging a security guard up and down the aisles of a <a href=#>Morrisons </a>while they shot up the supermarket as shoppers ran in terror.</p><p>In their final job on industrial estate in Stockport ended in mayhem when a lorry driver witnessed a security guard being attacked.</p><p>The have-a-hero drove his cement mixer straight at the gangster's car. One of the crew fired a shot at the cab, shooting the driver in the face. The hero survived but had to undergo major surgery.</p><p>In June 1998, David was jailed for twenty-six years and his brother Ade for fifteen years.</p><p><strong>The King of the Hill</strong></p><p><a href=#>Stephen Akinyemi </a>roared around the streets of Manchester in a silver Porsche with a personalised number plate "AKI".</p><p>Akinyemi , from Cheetham Hill, had been a suspect in the shooting of Chinada Iheagwara, who was murdered in 2002.

Akie arrived at Mr Coghlan's converted chapel wearing a body armour and a stab-proof vest.</p><p>The two men are said to have had a fight during which Akie died. Mr Coghlan was charged with murder after calling police who found Akinyemi dead with gunshot and stab wounds.</p><p>Mr Coghlan insisted he acted in self-defence in a tussle after Akinyemi aimed a gun at him. The murder charges were later dropped.</p><p>An inquest the following February at Warrington Coroner's Court delivered an open verdict.</p><p>A second inquest was held in 2017 where the coroner gave a narrative verdict, ruling Mr Coghlan had been "acting reasonably to defend himself".</p><p><strong>Counterfeit Street</strong></p><p>In recent years Bury New Road in Cheetham Hill became known as the country's capital for bootleg goods.</p><p>Christened 'Counterfeit Street' police from the across the country carried out raids in shops dotted along the main road.</p><p>The warren of shops specialised in fake designed gear, selling knock off <a href=#>Nike trainers </a>and counterfeit <a href=#>Manchester United</a> merchandise.</p><p>One man who who knows the area said: "Look mate it's Cheetham Hill not the Cotswolds. You had to crack on and make a few quid. Yes a few rules were broken but so what."</p><p>Last year police launched a wave of raids in the area, seizing over 1000 tonnes of counterfeit and shutting down 200 shops. Cops also recovered around £520,000 in cash.</p><p>Cops say their efforts have smashed the trade in fake goods, and reduced violent crime in the area by 50%.</p><p>Last year police launched a wave of raids in the area, seizing over 1000 tonnes of counterfeit and shutting down 200 shops.
