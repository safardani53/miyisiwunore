It wasn’t anything that I don’t think was planned.”</p><p>Nelly credited the separation for giving the pair a greater understanding of one another and noted that there is “no pressure” this time around.</p><p>“Before I felt like both of us were doing what we were doing before career-wise, and when you got so many people in the middle of it, it can be tough,” he confessed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Ashanti-and-Nelly-Don-t-Want-to-Rush-Relationship-After-Rekindling-Romance-320.jpg><p>Before the rapper’s public declaration, speculation sparked in April that the twosome were back on after they were <a href=#>spotted holding hands</a> at a boxing match in Las Vegas. Ashanti fueled rumors even further when she posted an Instagram Story that same night with what appeared to be Nelly’s hoodie visible in the background. “Oh hey,” she teased in the caption alongside a winky face emoji.</p><p>In August, Nelly posted a video of him and Ashanti <a href=#>getting cozy and singing</a> along to <a href=#><strong>Usher</strong></a>’s “Nice & Slow.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Ashanti-and-Nelly-Don-t-Want-to-Rush-Relationship-After-Rekindling-Romance-319.jpg><p>“I just want to take it nice and slow,” the duo sang in the clip. “See I’ve been waiting for this for so long.”</p><p>Ashanti and Nelly first connected at a press conference for the 45th Annual Grammy Awards. While they kept their romance on the down low at the start, heads turned when the musicians released their duets “Body on Me” and “Switch” in 2008.</p><p>Two years after their 2013 split, Ashanti <a href=#>addressed her breakup</a> from the rapper during a 2015 appearance on The Meredith Vieira Show where she admitted she felt “betrayed” by Nelly.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I think sometimes when people have their own insecurities it allows them to act out of character,” she said at the time. “I’ve been betrayed. Again, you just have to grow. You have to grow up and accept responsibility for the things that you do. I’m not a big fan of people being cowards. I think it’s really important to know yourself and understand what you want and get it. I’m in a different place right now.”</p><p>For more on Ashanti and Nelly’s rekindled love, pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaaq5iWu7W1jJqlnWWemrmtxYydpqesXayur8CMraZmqqWotW7Ax56gq2WimriqusOlnJ1lopq5osDIqKWsoJmlfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-oscar-schmidt-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Oscar Schmidt Dating Now</span></a>
