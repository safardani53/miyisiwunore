She paired the jumpsuit with a gray crepe duster and accessorized with silver jewelry. Her light orange hair was styled in thick curls that were full of body.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Sarah is expecting her first child about two years into her marriage with Australian comedian<strong> Dave Lawson</strong>. Sarah decided to reverse tradition and propose to Dave, and they walked down the aisle in a secret backyard ceremony in Brooklyn in 2021. “At the beginning of the pandemic last year, I got locked down in Melbourne with one of my best mates and we fell in love,” Sarah told<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Australian Vogue</a> in Oct. 2021, revealing the secret. “We’ve been friends since 2014, lived together, traveled together, always excited to see each other, but totally platonic. We’ve just never been single at the same time.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Dave has a son from a previous relationship whom he keeps out of the spotlight. “I can’t have regrets because I wouldn’t have [my son],” he said on the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Funny in Failure</a> podcast. “It’s that problem, if you go back in time and change one thing. A lot of it comes back to being a dad. If I change one thing … I wouldn’t want to risk undoing that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/succession-hbo-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>As Sarah creates her own family with Dave, though, she is leaving one behind. The fourth and final season of&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Succession </a>debuts on HBO on Mar. 26. At the premiere event, she noted that she and the cast have “become really close, like actual siblings.” She added, “[Succession ending is] a bummer, because it’s such a beloved show by both the people creating it, and the people watching it. But I think going out on a high is also a powerful thing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH10e5FpZqytk5iytL%2FIqKVmq5Gnrql50qemqKNdpb%2Bms82apa1loJ28tbuO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-selling-the-hamptons-related-to-selling-sunset.html><span>←</span><span>Is 'Selling the Hamptons' Related to 'Selling Sunset'?
