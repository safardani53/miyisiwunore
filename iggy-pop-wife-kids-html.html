She is his third wife and 25 years younger than him.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>By 2000, they had moved in together. Their wedding came eight years later, and so came the realization that he was fortunate to have met her.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>According to<a href=# rel="follow noopener"> AZCentral</a>, he likes to twerk around his house with his wife Alu if a good song is tuned in on the radio. According to him, she mastered the dancing style, partly because her dad originated from Nigeria.&nbsp;&nbsp;She is half-Irish and half-Nigerian. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>''When something with a good beat comes on, I twerk around the house with my wife," he shared.&nbsp;</p><p>The par is extremely private about their relationship and wants to protect their deep love from outside intervention.</p><p>"Nina Alu [an air stewardess] in 1999. We moved in together in 2000 and got married in November 2008. I found myself hitting 50 and realizing that I was lucky to meet her. Happiness with a woman doesn't need to be complicated. When you find the right one, it's easy," he revealed. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Alu is not active on social media, whereas her husband Iggy barely posts about his wife on his social profiles.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The husband and wife were last spotted together and clicked attending the '<a href=# rel="follow noopener">GQ Men of The Year Awards</a>' in 2019.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Before his third marriage [with Alu], he lived a wild life and had wilder dating history. Pop went through two marriages and divorces before he met Alu. One of these marriages only lasted a few weeks.</p><p>By the end of the 1980s, he was on drugs free, But back in the day, he did lots of drugs from cocaine, heroin, LSD, pills, and others.&nbsp;</p><p>"Going back, I had a binge on MDMA in the 1970s. And at a festival called Goose Lake in Michigan, I was snorting something they said was coke but I learned later was ketamine. I couldn’t remember who I was for about 12 hours. I remember smoking crack before it was called crack. It was frightening, he shared to <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Rolling Stone</a> in 2017.</p><h2>How many Kids Does Iggy Pop have?</h2><p>Pop has never had kids with his three wives. But he does, however, have a kid nonetheless.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>He had his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">son Eric</a>&nbsp;with his friend, Paulette Benson. However, he did not raise him. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Even though Eric worked for him in the ‘80s, they are reportedly not close</p><h2>How Iggy Pop’s Marriage with First Wife Ended</h2><p>His marriage with his first wife, Wendy Weissberg, ended with him kicking her out of the house they were living in.</p><p>This sent him into&nbsp;a frenzy of dating women for short periods of time, some of which were mere kids.</p><p>Iggy Pop <a href=# rel=follow>married</a> his Weissberg, in 1968. Their&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wedding was “fun,”</a>&nbsp;said Ron Asheton, his The Stooges bandmate.</p><p>Asheton was the best man at&nbsp;his wedding and a partner in crime in everything else.</p><p>Weissberg was Jewish and a daughter of a rich person who owned a chain of discount stores. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her parents didn’t recognize her marriage with Pop, and nobody from her family showed up.</p><p>After the wedding, she moved in with Pop. He was living with his bandmates at the time.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Iggy Pop poses for a photograph.</strong> (Photo: Iggy Pop/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>Pop living with them became a big issue for his marriage. She wanted to sleep at night. But Pop liked to party and make noise.</p><p>Eventually, the “Godfather of Punk” realized that it had to be one or the other — career or wife.</p><p>He refused to be quiet in the house, composing songs during the night and whenever else he pleased. This became the last straw for Weissberg.</p><p>Asheton was also the one to predict how long his marriage would last — a month. And he was right.</p><p>After&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">two weeks of marriage</a>, Pop told her to go. And she did, sending divorce papers a while later.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p>Weissberg stated in the papers that he had not consummated the marriage and that he was gay.</p><p>Everybody in the group found it hilarious and even hung the papers up on the wall “for ages.”</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Iggy Pop’s Relationships After First Marriage</h2><p>After Pop got handed the divorce papers, he returned to his old ways of being wild and free.</p><p>He started dating girls soon after, without a care in the world. “I was free again,” said the vocalist during one of his conversations on Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk.</p><p>He started roaming around and found a hamburger joint where kids hung out. There, he found inspiration for the first Stooges album and Betsy, a 14-year-old girl.</p><p>Pop developed a connection with her, and regardless of how many women he was seeing on the side, he always returned to her.</p><p>The musician&nbsp;even met her parents. But nothing came of that fling.</p><p>In another instance, he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">had a relationship</a>&nbsp;with Sable Starr, a 13-year-old kid. He was 23 at the time.</p><p>After many years of this frenzy, he found a wife for the second time in Suchi Asano. They got married in 1984 and divorced in 1998. Pop only took a year to find love again.</p><h2>Who was the 13-year-old who slept with&nbsp;&nbsp;Iggy?</h2><p>If we were to believe his song 'Look Away,' Iggy, in his twenties, slept with the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> infamous groupie Sable Starr </a>(who died in 2009)&nbsp;in 1970 and she was only three at the time. Here's the&nbsp;particular reference from the song's lyrics.</p><p>I slept with Sable when she was 13 / Her parents were too rich to do anything / She rocked her way around L.A / Until a New York Doll carried her away.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p>He had his first kiss at the age of 13 with a then 11-year-old girl named Diane. He shared with<a href=# rel="follow noopener"> The Sunday Morning Herald</a>,"&nbsp;My first kiss was with Diane Bishop - a caramel-colored girl who was prematurely voluptuous and lived in the same trailer park. My parents used to tell me to be careful of Diane. She was exotic and wore bikinis and had Native American blood. Diane was 11 and I was 13 when I managed to put the grab on her. It felt good to touch her. It was the first time I ever felt a girl and she was really soft."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKGXnMZuvM6pZLChlpp6rLXDrGWhrJ2h</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nba-all-star-game-jerseys-2020-kobe-gianna-bryant-meaning.html><span>←</span><span>NBA All-Star Game Jerseys 2020 Pay Tribute To Kobe &amp;amp; Gianna Bryant Hollywood Life</span></a>
