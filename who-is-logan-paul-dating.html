While some of those relationships were confirmed, some of have just been rumors.</p><p>But who is the Impaulsive podcast host dating now? And what about <a href=#>Logan's dating history</a>? Below, we take a look at his <a href=#>engagement to model Nina Agdal</a> as well details about his previous relationships.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Logan Paul dating? He's engaged to Nina Agdal.</h2><p><a href=#>Logan first met Nina</a> at an NYC event in 2022 and the two clicked right away. “I found out he was there and my gut was screaming that I had to say hi to him,” she later told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Front Row</a>. “I basically convinced him to meet me and my friends upstairs for a drink. I didn’t want to walk downstairs because of my bad back. He came upstairs and we started joking around. It instantly felt like I had known him for years, and here we are. It was wild!”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Nina Agdal and Logan Paul</p></figure><p>The two celebrated their one-year anniversary in May 2023, and by July, they were engaged. Logan got down on one knee while they were vacationing in Lake Como, Italy. "Engaged to my best friend," they both wrote on social media alongside <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their engagement pics</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Logan split from Josie Canseco in 2021.</h2><p>Logan was long rumored to be with Josie Conseco, though the pair rarely commented publicly on their relationship status. In January 2020, rumors started swirling that they had linked up after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> reported the pair were seen holding hands at the <a href=#>Rose Bowl</a> flea market. But it seems their relationship was not long-lived, as a year later, Josie admitted they were no longer together.</p><p>“Me and Logan split a little bit ago. … We’re like fine now,” she said in a January 2021 interview, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">J-14.</a> “I don’t know where we’re at exactly right now, but we love each other and we’re trying to find a respectable place. … Also he has a lot going on with his fight coming up. He has training camp, I’m just trying to be supportive and be what he needs in a partner and I think vice versa. We’re just kind of like figuring s--t out.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Josie Conseco</p></figure><p>Josie was spotted out on a date with G-Eazy in March 2021, suggesting she and Logan were off for good. There were briefly rumors that Logan was then romantically linked to <a href=#>Addison Rae</a>, though they both denied it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Logan was also linked to Chloe Bennet.</h2><p>Logan dated Chloe Bennet in 2018, and the pair were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted making out</a> while on vacation together in Hawaii. Chloe publicly defended her relationship with Logan, only for them to call it off after three months together in October 2018.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">He briefly dated Alissa Violet.</h2><p>Remember when the Paul brothers were engaged in a very public feud? Back in 2017, Jake and Logan were publicly fighting — over what we can't remember any more, but they took their argument to their social channels. Each brother posted a series of diss tracks about the other before they made up in one final rap video.</p><p>But it was in one of these videos that Logan confirmed he was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dating Jake's ex-girlfriend, Alissa Violet.</a></p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span><p>Logan Paul and Alissa Violet</p></figure><p>"Uh oh, that's Alissa Violet / Used to be your chick / Now she in the Logang and you know she on my... team," Logan rapped in "The Fall of Jake Paul."</p><p>Their relationship didn't last very long, though, before Alissa moved on to FaZe Banks. Jake commented on Logan's relationship with his ex in his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">docuseries</a> with Shane Dawson.&nbsp;</p><p>"[Logan] basically said, ‘oh I didn’t think you guys were actually a thing and that you were actually dating,'” he said.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">He was public about his relationship with Amanda Cerny.</h2><p>Fellow content creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amanda Cerny</a> was probably Logan's most public relationship. The model and former Vine star dated Logan in 2016, and the pair vlogged a lot of their relationship. Granted, it might've been mostly for views, but it was probably the most public about a significant other that Logan has ever been.</p><p>The pair haven't been seen together since 2017, though, so it's safe to say they didn't last very long.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span><p>Amanda Cerny and Logan Paul</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Let's not forget his relationship with Jessica Serfaty.</h2><p>Logan's relationship with <a href=#>model Jessica Serfaty</a> was arguably his longest one. The pair were together from 2014 to 2016, and may have even lived together at one point, though they both kept a lot of the details of their relationship very private.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span><p>Logan Paul and Jessica Serfaty</p></figure><p>It's currently unclear why they broke up, but some suspect there was infidelity involved that led to them calling it quits.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKWnl5a7brzArqNmnJGptq%2Bz</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-gypsy-rose-boyfriend.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened to Gypsy Rose's Boyfriend?</span></a>
