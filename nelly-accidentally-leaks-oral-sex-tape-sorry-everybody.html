The 47-year-old rapper leaked a video of himself on the receiving end of a sex act.
Nelly has apologized to those who saw the video in the last place they’d expect to see it, and implied that he’d been hacked.
What makes this even weirder is the reactions that some on social media loudly posted, turning the event into an uninvited critique."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

That can be life-changing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Also addressing multiple news outlets, Nelly’s team shared that they are "investigating a breach."</p><p>The team admitted that they are "concerned" that "more of Nelly’s private content may also end up online."</p><p>This could be "including financial information, personal documents, and passwords."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Sometimes, celebrities simply post the wrong thing in the wrong place — as anyone potentially might.</p><p>Most people have only a few thousand followers on any given account, and can quickly delete things to cover their mistake.</p><p>But someone like Nelly, with 3.3 million Instagram followers, knows that even the briefest post will live online forever.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In Nelly’s case, the statement seems to imply that he was not responsible for the post, that someone else may have accessed his account.</p><p>It’s possible that the rapper is being blackmailed or is otherwise the target of malicious electronic activity.</p><p>That said, it is also possible that Nelly’s team is hoping to help him to save face for something much more accidental.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>One odd and especially unkind aspect of the response to Nelly’s leaked video has been some ridicule of his penis.</p><p>We wouldn’t really touch on this topic if there weren’t so much of it on social media.</p><p>But a lot of people felt the need to mock Nelly’s penis as shown in the video, declaring it to be "small" and even roasting the woman by extension.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>There’s an odd amount of clout-chasing on social media that can make people especially toxic and overly negative.</p><p>People like to make themselves appear smarter and more discerning by declaring how much they dislike something popular, for example.</p><p>By the same token, it looks like some people were trying to prove that they have lofty standards of penises.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In the video, Nelly appeared to be above average in length and girth, but another factor in reactions may be a combination of inexperience and porn.</p><p>A lot of people on social media have, for many years, accidentally confessed their total lack of familiarity with sex due to limited experience with real partners.</p><p>It’s likely that the pandemic has made this worse, and so porn and widely circulated dong photos have given people skewed ideas of the human body.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>We’re not Nelly fans — especially not after multiple women accused him of sexual assault several years ago.</p><p>Even so, it would be nice to see social media denizens stop feeling that they have to prove to others that they’re the harshest critics (and biggest size queens).</p><p>This was not posted deliberately by Nelly or by the woman who appeared in the video. It’s not like it was submitted for evaluation, c’mon.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2V%2FcLrEpaOyZZGYsKqwxKermqScrnqtscCkqmanopa5br%2FEsWStmaCaerS70auwZp2mmr%2B6rs6dsGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leah-pritchett.html><span>←</span><span>Leah Pritchett- Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Ethnicity</span></a>
