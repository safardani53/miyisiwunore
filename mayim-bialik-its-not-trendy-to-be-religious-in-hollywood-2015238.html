Big Bang Theory star <strong>Mayim Bialik</strong> spoke out about her religious views in a recent interview with Fox News — and said that she doesn’t think Hollywood is very friendly to people who are outspoken about their faith. Bialik has long been open about her Orthodox Jewish faith.</p><p>“I think in general it’s never going to be trendy to be observant or religious in Hollywood circles,” <a href=#>she told FOX411</a>. “There are people I know of faith and we tend to congregate together. I study Jewish texts weekly. That’s something positive to me when you’re a person of faith, it stays with you all the time.”</p><p>Bialik, 39, explained that she had recently taken a trip to Israel to visit a friend in the Israel Defense Forces, and her fans had reacted angrily.</p><p>“I’ve gotten a lot of negative attention for visiting Israel,” she said. “That’s what’s amazing … simply by going to Israel this summer and saying nothing more than, ‘I’ve gone to Israel,’ I got the same amount of hatred and threats and anti-Semitism for actually making a statement trying to support people whether I like it or not are serving in an army.”</p><p>The former Blossom star and mother of two has been outspoken before about her self-admittedly “modest” views. Last September, Bialik took to her blog to <a href=#>criticize <strong>Ariana Grande</strong></a> for being scantily clad on a billboard.</p><p>“I am a bleeding heart liberal without exception,” she wrote in September 2014. “But I am old-fashioned. My kids have clothes they wear only to synagogue. I don’t favor my kids cursing. I dress modestly. I don’t want my kids learning about sex from billboards. Stuff like that. Which is why a few billboards I have seen lately really bug me.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>That same month, the actress also criticized Disney’s hit animated film&nbsp;Frozen, which caused <strong>Rosie O’Donnell</strong> to <a href=#>bash the former teen star</a>.</p><p>“I feel that Frozen is the best Disney movie ever made,” O’Donnell said on The View. “I’ve seen it 250 times. I can say it, I have every word memorized, [and] I love it like the rest of America.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammameum6uyJqjoqNdnsG0ec2oq2asopq7pcWMraZmmpViv6a4yKCgqK2jYraveceoo6Wxp6S8pXmRaWhuamNtfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kanye-west-louis-vuitton-boycott-feud-yves-carcelle.html><span>←</span><span>Kanye West Tells Fans To Boycott Louis Vuitton After VP Denies To Meet Him Hollywood Life</span></a>
