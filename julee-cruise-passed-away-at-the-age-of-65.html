Her spouse, Edward Grinnan, survives her. They married in 1988 and lived in both Manhattan and Berkshire. Her spouse made the announcement on his Facebook page, writing,</p><p>“I felt those of you who go back may be interested to hear that I bid farewell to my wife, Julee Cruise, today.” She walked out from this world on her own terms. There are no regrets. She is content. She frequently said that the time she spent as a B standing in for Cindy while she was having a family was the greatest moment of her performance life.”</p><p>Grinnan went on to say,</p><p>“She will be eternally thankful to them.” When she first took the stage with Fred and Kate, she compared it to joining the Beatles. She will always adore them and remember their global journeys together. During her transformation, I played her Roam. She will now wander indefinitely. My darling, rest in peace, and love to you all.”</p><h2>Twitter users pay tribute</h2><p>Julee Cruise grew to notoriety throughout the years as a prominent musician, singer, songwriter, and actor.
