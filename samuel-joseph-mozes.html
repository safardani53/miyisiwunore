He was born on November 9, 1996, in New York, USA, making him 26 years old.</p><p>Mozes attracted media attention not only because he is the son of a celebrity, but also because his mother revealed the truth about his sexuality as a transgender. That curiosity grew into a strong desire to learn everything there was to know about Cynthia Nixon’s son with her ex-partner.</p><h2>Samuel Joseph Mozes Biography</h2><p><strong>Samuel Joseph Mozes</strong> is 27 years old and was born on November 8, 1996, in New York City, United States of America, under the birth sign of Scorpio. The celebrity child has the rights and privileges of an American citizen as a result of his birth in the country. Samuel is a member of the Caucasian ethnic group.</p><p>As previously stated, Samuel Nixon is Cynthia Nixon’s son, whom she had with her ex-long-term partner, Danny Mozes, before their divorce in the early 2000s. Seph, as Samuel Joseph is affectionately known, witnessed his parents’ divorce when he was only seven years old.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Samuel-Mosez-2-1.jpg><h2>Samuel Joseph Mozes Father Profession</h2><p><strong>Samuel’s father, Danny Mozes</strong>, used to be a school teacher, where he met his wife, Cynthia Nixon. Before their relationship blossomed into something more serious and romantic in nature, Samuel Joseph Mozes’ parents had a teacher-student relationship.</p><p>They began dating in 1988 and had a relationship that lasted for a decade and a half. There is no record of a wedding date, but according to some sources, the former couple was married. They stayed together, and after having Samuel Joseph in 1996, they also had his younger brother, Charles Ezekiel Mozes. Charles Ezekiel Mozes, the celebrity kid’s brother, was born in 2002, just a year before his parents ended their fifteen-year marriage.</p><h2>Samuel Joseph Mozes Mother Relationship</h2><p>Samuel’s mother began a romantic relationship with her current partner, Christine Marinoni, not long after her divorce from Danny Mozes. According to records, Cynthia’s romantic affair with Christine, a gay rights activist, was the actress’s first romantic relationship with a woman. It also appears to be going well because the lesbian couple has remained together as a family since 2004.</p><p>Samuel and his brother, Charles, have been living with her mother and her new gay partner since his parents’ divorce. Seph’s new family was joined by a new baby stepbrother. Max Ellington Nixon Marinoni was reportedly born in 2011, and eight years later, Samuel Joseph’s mother and her new lesbian lover married in 2012.</p><h2>Samuel Joseph Mozes Was Theatre Assistant Director</h2><p>The public and the media are not privy to many details about Samuel Joseph Mozes’ early formal education background. It is widely assumed that he has a high school diploma from a high school in his hometown of New York City.</p><p>Following that, the celebrity kid attended the University of Chicago. He graduated with a degree in English Literature and Poetry after completing the required time at the institution. According to close sources, after graduating from the University of Chicago, the celebrity kid stated his intention to further his studies by obtaining a master’s degree in English Literature and Poetry. The motivation for this decision was revealed to be a desire to work as a creative writer and published author.</p><p>While the jury is still out on Seph’s stated intentions, a summary of his bio on Writers Theatre revealed that he is a dramaturg and director who previously worked as a literary intern at Northlight Theatre and Writers Theatre. He reportedly worked as an assistant director to Jess McLeod on the Northlight Theatre production Landladies.</p><p>Following that, he worked as an assistant director on a Redtwist production of King Lear. In his early career, Samuel Joseph Mozes worked in the Outreach Department of Steppenwolf Theatre Company. However, the biography of Samuel Joseph Mozes is said to be correct as of 2019, and not much has been learned since then. However, it appears that his artistic abilities are currently restricted to the stage.</p><p>It also appears that the nearly three-decade-old celebrity child is following in the footsteps of his talented mother, whose talents as an actress have remained ingrained in the hearts and minds of the American public since her days as a fictional lawyer in HBO’s Sex and The City series, as well as the two movies of the same name that followed on the heels of the series.</p><h2>Samuel Joseph Mozes Has Revealed That He Is Transgender</h2><p><strong>Samuel Joseph Mozes</strong> got his current nickname, Seph, after coming out as transgender in 2018 to commemorate <strong>#TransDayofAction</strong>. It was a proud moment for his mother, Cynthia Nixon, who came out as bisexual in 2007 and later as queer in 2012.</p><p>To put things in perspective, Samuel Joseph Mozes was born Samantha Mozes in 1996 and only took the name Samuel Joseph, nickname Seph, after revealing his gender identity in 2018.</p><p>Cynthia Nixon took to Instagram to commemorate and document a pivotal moment in her son’s life, posting a photo of herself and Seph on his college graduation date. Words of encouragement poured in for the actress and her transgender son, none more so than from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who tweeted Cynthia’s Instagram post.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqmqWlmrluts6snKmgXaK8u7HSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./riccardo-tisci.html><span>←</span><span>Riccardo Tisci</span></a>
