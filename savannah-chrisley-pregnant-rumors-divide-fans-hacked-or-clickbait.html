I genuinely do, It’s been posting weird things.”</p><p>Some similar posts on Savannah’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Facebook page</a> including one that suggests her parents got “divorced” are still live. One from June 16 reads “official divorce statement,” despite Todd and Julie Chrisley still being together.</p><p>It’s unclear whether Savannah shares the posts herself or if she had been hacked with her ‘pregnancy’ announcement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfo7K4v46smK%2BZnqOuqXnCoamiq5yaxm680Z6ep5meqXqzwcyoqaxllJ7DqrDEZp2apqNitaKvyp6bZqeiYrCttcKkmZqhpA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-did-antonio-armstrong-jr-do.html><span>←</span><span>What Did Antonio Armstrong Jr. Do?</span></a>
