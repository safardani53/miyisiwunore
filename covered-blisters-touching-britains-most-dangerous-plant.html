I'm scared to have it out in the sun, because I don't want that to happen again.</p><p>"I can't let any sun through otherwise I end up with third-degree burns, and that's what it basically was - that's what's happened to me."</p><p>Councillor Shantanu Rajawat, leader of Hounslow Council, said: "We are sorry to hear of this incident and hope the individuals affected are recovering.</p><p>"I want to assure residents and visitors to our much-loved award winning parks that this is a rare event.</p><p>"We have a dedicated team that manage our parks across the borough who work hard to ensure they are safe for everyone including the treatment and removal of harmful plant life such as Giant Hogweed.</p><p>"Where found, the Council and our partners will arrange for a specialist removal to be undertaken, with priority given to those areas which are easily accessible to the public.</p><p>"In response to this incident our Parks Teams have placed an additional cordon and signage in the area to warn park users of the risks of coming into contact with Giant Hogweed.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"We will continue to monitor the area closely.</p><p>"Where incidents and accidents occur, affected park users are encouraged to contact the council quickly so that we can provide support and swiftly act to ensure other park users are not impacted."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/turriff-aberdeenshire-scotland-uk-photo-824696808.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/d66e439e-3922-41de-9966-53f87c0eff1a.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/brentford-london-england-uk-photo-827024479.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIV1gJFvcHJnk6TDpr7EnWSbpJmowaa%2B0marqK2Tnbavs4ybqaKskZ67tHnMqKqtZZSWu6ix0aisrGWgoa6vwI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tai-babilonia.html><span>←</span><span>Tai Babilonia</span></a>
