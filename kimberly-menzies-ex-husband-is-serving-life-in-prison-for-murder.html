They were teenagers at the time.</p><p>The brothers faced charges of two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of robbery with a dangerous weapon.</p><p>They also faced charges of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, one count of discharging a firearm into an occupied property. Also, one count of possession of a stolen vehicle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>So what happened?</p><p>According to authorities, 19-year-old Tilmon and 17-year-old Kevin killed two white police officers during a traffic stop in Fayetteville, North Carolina.</p><p>The trial ended up being rushed, scheduled just five months after the crime. The jury trial took place in one county, with the jury selected from another.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>That’s super weird, especially since Johnston County — where the jurors originate — is conspicuously whiter than Cumberland County.</p><p>Johnston County may be adjacent to much more populous and diverse counties, but Johnston is best known for its pork industry.</p><p>The report does not explain how the court justified a rushed trial that seemingly picked and chose its jury from another county.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The imported jury worked as prosecutors had intended, apparently.</p><p>Both brothers received a guilty verdict.</p><p>The court sentenced both teenagers to death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“He was sent to death row, and she began writing and visiting him more frequently,” the insider revealed.</p><p>“She felt like there was more to the case than met the eye,” the source noted. Yes, we also get that impression.</p><p>Obviously, the insider acknowledged: “She does not condone what they did or say it was right.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“She was not in love with him but loved him as a person,” the source said of Kimberly and Kevin.</p><p>“He needed someone to be his power of attorney, and that was it,” the insider explained.</p><p>The source added: “The whole thing lasted about two years before it was annulled.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Specifically, Kimberly married Kevin in 1999. Two years later, they had the marriage annulled.</p><p>Not only is Kevin not Jamal’s father, but he and Kimberly never consummated their marriage.</p><p>She saw a young adult sentenced to death and obtained the legal leverage to advocate on his behalf. It was an act of compassion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Remember, Kevin and Tilmon’s sentencing took place in the ’90s.</p><p>North Carolina later banned the death penalty for minors, no matter the crime. Kevin received a life sentence.</p><p>Additionally, a judge ruled that racial discrimination had illegally impacted Tilmon’s trial. In September of 2020, he too received a life sentence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Kimberly and Kevin are still friends. He knows about the show, of course.</p><p>“Kevin wants her to be his wing woman once he is released from jail,” the insider detailed.</p><p>And the source then added: “Her past is her past and has nothing to do with her present.” Naturally.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WGcLfIppmeqpyueq6xzbOgnqtdmsVutNSsmZqmlGK2tHnSnqmvoZ6ceq21xZ5koqZdpb%2Bqv86nZJ%2BnomK6tr7Dnqlo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jewel-tankard.html><span>←</span><span>Jewel Tankard Biography</span></a>
