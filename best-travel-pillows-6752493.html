But the right head and neck support can make your journey much more enjoyable, especially if you're boarding a long flight. We're talking about travel pillows, of course, which come in a range of styles, sizes, and materials. "There are tons of different types," says award-winning travel host Valerie Joy Wilson of Trusted Travel Girl. "Some will cushion around your neck, and some just go on the side of your neck."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">So, what makes some better than others? "Comfort is the number one thing," says travel expert Rana Good, explaining that a high-quality cushion should help you get some sleep and not wake up in pain. "Also, hygiene is a big factor." In other words, an easy-to-clean design is ideal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tested 24 top-rated pillows to find the most comfortable, portable, durable, low-maintenance options. After trying them out in real-life settings, including flights, train rides, and road trips, we narrowed it down to options worth buying.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for the best travel pillows PEOPLE tested.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-cabeau-evolution-classic-travel-pillow></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cabeau Evolution Classic Travel Pillow</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cabeau Evolution Classic Travel Pillow" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/3CoP59UD3McND09xpZwFiH67bas=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cabeau-evolution-classic-travel-pillow-066299b7c2bd4d71a7442c68d3202838.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Cloud-like memory foam conforms to shape of head and neck</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Supportive but not too soft or firm</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Conveniently machine-washable cover</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Clocking perfect scores in all our tests, the Cabeau Evolution Classic is by far our favorite travel pillow. A perfect option for plane travel, we loved how the responsive memory foam conformed to our heads and necks. Not too soft or too firm with excellent support, laying down on it was like dozing off on a cloud. And when you're done using it, it quickly regains its normal shape. Our tester wore this on two ten-hour flights and now packs it every time she travels.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're watching an in-flight movie, reading a book, or just relaxing, this cushion will make the experience much more comfortable. It seems well-made too. Though the velour exterior is removable and machine-washable, it doesn't shift around when zipped onto the pillow. There are also handy toggle clasps on the front to ensure it stays in position while allowing you to hook it to your luggage. The clasps come undone kind of easily, but in the end, this is a minor drawback.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"I personally love Cabeau memory foam neck pillows," says Wilson. The Evolution Classic is very reasonably priced and gives higher-end options a run for their money. It did its job and exceeded our expectations for comfort, durability, and portability. We'd recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality on-the-go neck pillow.<strong></strong></p><p>Dimensions: 10 x 9.5 x 5 inches | <strong>Core Material:</strong> Memory foam | <strong>Cover Material:</strong> Velour</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Daniela Galvez</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-cloudz-microbead-travel-neck-pillow></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cloudz Microbead Travel Neck Pillow</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cloudz Microbead Travel Neck Pillow" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/IdKrMyzKlVJyEdFVOoap21JY1wQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cloudz-microbead-travel-neck-pillow-18964ecb0b5640568fdef50db77cd40e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>Comfortable and supportive for long trips</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Microbeads conform to the shape of head and neck</p></li><li readability=1><p>Soft, breathable, tear-resistant exterior</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On a budget? The Cloudz Original Travel Pillow is a solid choice. After trying it out on a six-hour flight and a three-hour train ride, we're happy to report it's exceptionally comfortable and supportive. The ultra-soft fabric seems tear-resistant and breathable too. Though it doesn't compress, it's filled with lightweight microbeads that conform to the shape of your neck and head.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Cloudz Pillow isn't the best option for packing in a carry-on or backpack, but we liked how the clasp keeps it in place when walking around. You can also attach it to your suitcase or bag. Although this travel pillow doesn't have a removable cover, the exterior is easy to spot-clean. Affordable price aside, we'd recommend this product to anyone going on a long flight, train ride, or road trip.<strong></strong></p><p>Dimensions: 12 x 12 x 4 inches | <strong>Core Material:</strong> Foam beads | <strong>Cover Material:</strong> Polyester</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-ostrich-pillow-go-neck-pillow></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Splurge</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ostrich Pillow Go Neck Pillow</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ostrichpillow Go Neck Pillow" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/-plDbE4zEKb1l1pcOVNQlajqmBc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ostrichpillow-go-neck-pillow-764ddb977e56429d8691f504285c96e2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>Wrap-around design with plush, marshmallow-like feel</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Supports neck and chin while preventing stiffness</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Compresses to about half its size</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're willing to pay a little extra for the best of the best, go with Ostrichpillow. The brand's Go Neck Pillow is one of the few options that earned perfect scores in all testing categories. After using it on a short domestic flight and a long international flight, we were sold on the comfortable design. It feels like wrapping a marshmallow around your neck.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This wrap-around neck cushion has a memory foam core, a soft and stretchy machine-washable cover, and adjustable velcro closure for a custom fit. It supported our necks and chins, keeping our heads securely in place while sitting upright and preventing stiffness. Not only that, but the Go Neck Pillow compresses to about half its size for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>compact packing</a>. And thanks to the modern design, you won't feel dorky wearing it. The only potential downside is that it gets slightly warm after a few hours. Still, we think it's well worth the investment, especially if you travel often.<strong></strong></p><p>Dimensions: 10 x 6.5 x 3 inches | <strong>Core Material:</strong> Memory foam | <strong>Cover Material:</strong> Viscose, elastomer</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=4032 data-sizes=750px alt="an Ostrich Pillow Go Neck Pillow displayed on a table" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/PzoFhiPLHzWuzpr4w6l4nSszAIM=/fit-in/1500x4032/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ostrich-pillow-susan-brickell-04-e0ddb503c9c9421f9cc962ca7c9c4591.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Susan Brickell</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=3088 data-sizes=750px alt="A woman on an airplane shown wearing an Ostrich Pillow Go Neck Pillow around her neck" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/17tBJBnW8Y79kdfEo4K26zmnYYA=/fit-in/1500x3088/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ostrich-pillow-susan-brickell-06-b2c4b72db1b248d2922bdfcab629c36a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Susan Brickell</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-neck-support-j-pillow-chin-supporting-neck-pillow></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Neck Support</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>J-Pillow Chin-Supporting Neck Pillow</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="J-Pillow Chin-Supporting Neck Pillow" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ccWgFhnrie7UlD7x7Bx5j5c9qmk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/j-pillow-chin-supporting-neck-pillow-bd5a5bd8442e41b6858912c598badfc7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Unique shape with ear divot supports from the side</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Easy to sleep upright almost anywhere</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Entire pillow is machine-washable</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If it's neck support you're after, the J-Pillow has your name on it. After using it on a 19-hour car ride, we awarded it perfect scores in all categories. We loved the responsive memory foam core and unique J shape. The clever design is meant to go on one side of your head, almost like you're leaning on someone's shoulder. There's also a little divot for your ear. This makes it easy to take a nap, no matter where you're seated.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike C-shaped pillows, you can't really walk around with it on your neck, but you could attach the included carry bag to your luggage. The exterior is soft and plush, and we didn't notice any loose strings or snags. And while it doesn't have a removable cover, the entire thing is machine-washable.<strong></strong></p><p>Dimensions: 13 x 12 x 8 inches | <strong>Core Material:</strong> Memory foam | <strong>Cover Material:</strong> Poly-blend fabric</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-2 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=4032 data-sizes=750px alt="a person shown holding up a J-Pillow Chin-Supporting Neck Pillow" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/1q1KQerOJm-zK2Pt8aIR_4793GM=/fit-in/1500x4032/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/j-pillow-chin-supporting-neck-pillow-jennifer-may-02-645965f21ede461b92bf3bc671a642b3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jennifer May</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=3088 data-sizes=750px alt="A woman shown in a car resting her head against a J-Pillow Chin-Supporting Neck Pillow" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/RVwB97Q7_7NoyrELllWZzAAv_wk=/fit-in/1500x3088/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/j-pillow-chin-supporting-neck-pillow-jennifer-may-03-6b7241f098484926984a559258309eb0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jennifer May</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-compact-aeris-memory-foam-travel-pillow></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Compact</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Aeris Memory Foam Travel Pillow</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Aeris Memory Foam Travel Pillow" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/N7zn3TDveefA3nnLsiFustGjAY4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/aeris-memory-foam-travel-pillow-435863bdfa12439595dc7528a1690d55.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Easily compresses into bag half its size</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Provides ideal balance of plushness and support</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Perfect for naps on road trips and flights</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Aeris Travel Pillow isn't technically the smallest option on our list. However, it's made of compressible memory foam and fits into an included carrying bag half its size. Stuffing it into the bag was a breeze. But that's not the only thing we liked about this neck cushion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After trying it out on a six-hour road trip and a five-hour flight, we can tell you it provides an ideal balance of softness and support. Since the memory foam is on the firmer side, you may not want to sleep with it for longer periods. Still, it's perfect for in-transit naps. The super-soft velour cover features high-quality stitching and a sturdy zipper, allowing you to remove and wash it as needed. All things considered, this is an excellent travel pillow with a very reasonable price tag.<strong></strong></p><p>Dimensions: 13.5 x 11 x 5 inches | <strong>Core Material:</strong> Memory foam | <strong>Cover Material:</strong> Velour</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-4 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=4032 data-sizes=750px alt="Aeris Memory Foam Travel Pillow displayed on a sheet beside accessories" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/e3IRr7hk59MYpE3TKPFFE3WlMwY=/fit-in/1500x4032/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/aeris-memory-foam-travel-pillow-anna-popp-04-9133fad256874d7bb102ced3f0af79e8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Anna Popp</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-5 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=3024 data-sizes=750px alt="A woman in a car shown wearing a Aeris Memory Foam Travel Pillow around her neck in the car" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/AUryQosTzOhV2OniGG3WJWELelg=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/aeris-memory-foam-travel-pillow-anna-popp-01-c534c32720994f7a9ca1c2d347310521.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Anna Popp</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-versatile-therm-a-rest-compressible-pillow></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Most Versatile</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Therm-a-Rest Compressible Pillow</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Therm-a-Rest Compressible Pillow" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/BaJhSpGmREr6TO56TMkTyNlaPIQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Therm-a-Rest-Compressible-Pillow--0d91bed8c0f34af48cca615b8530c5c6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>REI</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>Lofty yet conveniently compressible; packs into itself</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Feels almost like real bed pillow</p></li><li readability=1><p>Perfect for flights, camping, and on-the-go naps</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Prefer more of a standard shape?

Besides being immensely comfy and highly portable, we like that this travel cushion is made of upcycled and recycled materials.

We tried this one from Gingerlily and were immediately impressed by the overall quality — the exterior was sumptuously smooth with no loose threads or fraying. It has a substantial feel that resists going flat. A great option to use on a plane, train, or car ride, it helped us stay comfy for a five-hour excursion and kept our hair sleek and frizz-free. We wish this pillow came with a removable case. While the whole thing is machine-washable, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">laundry bag</a> is sold separately.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We like how it's shaped like a regular bed pillow. Although not as big, it's still larger than most travel pillows, so you may need to bring it as your "personal item" for plane travel rather than packing it. However, if you're a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>silk pillowcase</a> devotee at home, this pillow is substantial enough that you could use it not just en route but also at night at your hotel or vacation rental.<strong></strong></p><p>Dimensions: 12 x 16 inches | <strong>Core Material:</strong> Mulberry silk, polyester | <strong>Cover Material:</strong> Mulberry silk</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-durable-cabeau-the-necks-evolution-s3-tne-neck-pillow></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Durable</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cabeau TNE S3 Travel Pillow</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cabeau The Neck's Evolution S3 (TNE) Neck Pillow" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/PILMmLGSnqUyuQBfnkqtwqRyzkg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Cabeau-The-Necks-Evolution-S3-TNE-Neck-Pillow-7193a2436ae4405592e7f213c8b288fd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>Plush yet supportive with soft, cozy exterior</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Prevents head bobbing while sleeping upright</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Durable design stands up to wear and tear</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The high-quality design of Cabeau's Evolution TNE S3 Pillow was apparent right off the bat. It's plush yet supportive with a super soft and cozy exterior that never makes you feel hot or stuffy. Since it's on the thicker side, it felt a little odd at first while we got into a comfortable position. But once we got used to it, we were sold. The chin and headrest straps keep it secure, but it stays in place and prevents your head from bobbing around even if you don't use them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We used this travel pillow for the duration of a 12-day trip, including on planes, trains, and buses. By the last day, it looked just as good as when we pulled it out of the packaging. Though it seems bulky at first, it folds into a compact ball and fits easily into the included carrying case. You can also attach it to a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>carry-on suitcase</a> or bag using the clip. The removable cover lost some softness after washing it, but not much. Backed by a one-year warranty, the TNE S3 Pillow seems like it'll hold up for a long time. The value is undeniable, so it's definitely worth the investment.<strong></strong></p><p>Dimensions: 11 x 7.5 x 6.5 inches | <strong>Core Material:</strong> Memory foam | <strong>Cover Material:</strong> Polyester, microsuede</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-6 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="A person wearing an eye mask and the Cabeau The Neck's Evolution S3 (TNE) Neck Pillow while on a plane" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/OyQoz40tA3TJKwVnbevyWd9ioIY=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-travel-pillows-test-cabeau-tne-s3-anna-popp-9-6a50424c4fca4e92b763fadf617f7948.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Anna Popp</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-7 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="The Cabeau The Neck's Evolution S3 (TNE) Neck Pillow in a traveling case attached to a suitcase" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/3zWpQp3nh9-SQFr60LuPr0cJs5Y=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-travel-pillows-test-cabeau-tne-s3-anna-popp-4-3520de47d9364450b8bc935cec2c1055.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Anna Popp</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cooling-cabeau-evolution-cool-pillow></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Cooling</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cabeau Evolution Cool Pillow</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/lLq8-Nwz6qxA1_7XuUgmFi5m5Ho=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cabeau-evolution-cool-pillow-a8e95cc224f942b5bd2cb7a54f75563c.jpg"><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Prevents heat from getting trapped; good for hot sleepers</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Supportive and firm but not too hard</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Durable design retains shape through repeated compressing</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also liked Cabeau's Evolution Cool Pillow. An ideal choice for people who sleep hot or get night sweats, the airy, ventilated design is supposed to prevent heat from getting trapped in the memory foam. After trying it out firsthand, we can tell you it works as promised. We found this neck cushion to be extremely supportive and firm but not too hard. It's slightly awkward to position at first, but rest assured, you'll be able to sleep upright on a plane — even in the middle seat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though the exterior is soft, it's not the softest option we tried. Still, we appreciate that the zippered cover is removable and machine-washable. This travel pillow also compresses to fit in its included storage bag and maintains its original shape after being repeatedly rolled and unrolled. It's durable, likely long-lasting, and, most importantly, helps you doze comfortably in a seated position without getting stuffy.<strong></strong></p><p>Dimensions: 13 x 7 x 5 inches | <strong>Core Material:</strong> Memory foam | <strong>Cover Material:</strong> Polyester</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-firm-cushion-lab-ergonomic-travel-neck-pillow></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Firm</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cushion Lab Ergonomic Travel Neck Pillow</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cushion Lab Ergonomic Travel Neck Pillow" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/hOpb6f18J1NEP9LhqQGdeWc4HTE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Cushion-Lab-Ergonomic-Travel-Neck-Pillow-85d441dc59cb45b0b9ecccea9b1c675c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Brookstone</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Thoughtful ergonomic design with adjustable fit</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Supports chin and head to keep neck strain at bay</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Continuously comfortable for long hours</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Cushion Lab's take on the travel pillow is this semi-firm C-shaped number. The ergonomic design is very snug, almost like a neck brace, though the strap allows you to adjust the fit. While the shape may take some getting used to, it's not uncomfortable at all. In fact, it's quite the opposite. Made of high-density foam and memory foam, it supports your chin, prevents your head from bobbing around, and promises to minimize neck strain.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We were able to sleep comfortably on long car rides and train rides, with no neck pain to speak of afterward. This travel pillow has a machine-washable cover and a handy carrying bag with a carabiner clip. It rolls up easily into the bag, but unfortunately, the clip is a little too small to attach to luggage — it should hook to a purse or backpack, though. If you have a hard time getting comfortable enough to doze off on trains, planes, or cars, this portable pillow might be a game-changer.<strong></strong></p><p>Dimensions: 10 x 9 x 5 inches, 9 x 8 x 4 inches | <strong>Core Material:</strong> High-density foam, memory foam | <strong>Cover Material:</strong> Cotton-poly blend</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-8 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=1512 data-sizes=750px alt="a young girl asleep on a train resting her head and neck on a Cushion Lab Ergonomic Travel Neck Pillow " data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/mEphdOa4DnR_JQaufJD7D4h2RWc=/fit-in/1500x1512/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cushion-lab-ergonomic-travel-neck-pillow-alessandra-amodio-06-72124b3f4d4840d3a4b615ebfc3c0c4e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>People / Alessandra Amodio</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=1512 data-sizes=750px alt="a Cushion Lab Ergonomic Travel Neck Pillow attached to a rolling suitcase" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/IVyL55jD4pCZR28A16t_DvMWCaU=/fit-in/1500x1512/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cushion-lab-ergonomic-travel-neck-pillow-alessandra-amodio-08-2fabc5b32e0f481e88bcaaf259906eca.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>People / Alessandra Amodio</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-travel-pillow></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying a Travel Pillow</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Shape</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"The most common travel pillow you'll see at the airport is the [C-shaped] neck pillow," says Good.

Despite the size, Good says the best travel pillows can be "stored neatly in your bag" next to other <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>travel accessories</a>, like your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>wired earbuds</a> and a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>blackout sleep mask</a>. This could mean it's small or compresses down into a compact shape. Some come with carrying cases that hook to your luggage, and C-shaped designs can be worn around your neck if they don't fit anywhere else — it probably won't count as your "one personal item." And of course, you can keep it in your bag in a compressed case and pull it out once you're settled into your seat.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-efd85194-a875-49c2-b42e-6f23e87b78b7></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=44.646418857661><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.87647058823529><p><span class=accordion__title>Are expensive travel pillows worth it?</span></p><p>The <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Ostrichpillow Go Neck Pillow</a>, while the most expensive on the list, was rated 5/5 by our tester.

However, not being machine-washable won’t necessarily affect the travel pillow’s comfort and performance. In some cases, cushions without removable covers can be machine-washed as well. If not, you'll need to hand-wash or spot-clean your pillow. We made sure that any pillow we recommended that wasn't machine washable was easy to spot-clean, such as the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Cloudz Microbead Travel Neck Pillow</a>.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After researching today's best travel pillows, we selected 24 options to try firsthand.
