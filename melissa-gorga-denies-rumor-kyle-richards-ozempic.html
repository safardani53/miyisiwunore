I Never said @kylerichards18 was on ozempic,” the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>Real&nbsp;Housewives of New Jersey</i></a> star said. Melissa added, “I said she looks so amazing that i thought she was!! But she has totally confirmed that she’s not! The girl is working for it. 🙌🏼💪🏼 Give the lady some credit! We are laughing at all of this. We are good ❤️.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Melissa-Gorga-Slams-Rumors-Kyle-Richards-SS-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Melissa and Kyle are friends from season 1 of&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>Real&nbsp;Housewives: Ultimate&nbsp;Girls Trip</i></a>, so fans were surprised about the miscommunication over the Ozempic situation. It all started during Melissa’s interview on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jeff Lewis</strong></a>‘ radio show in January, where the mom-of-three admitted that she initially believed the rumors that Kyle was taking Ozempic. “I’m not gonna lie, when I first saw her, I was like, ‘Oh, she’s taking that stuff,” Melissa <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>said on the show</a>, noting that she changed her mind once Kyle denied taking the drug. “And then, when she said that, I’m like, ‘Oh Okay maybe not.’ You know, I don’t know,” Melissa said. “I didn’t even text her&nbsp;and ask her.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Kyle eventually addressed Melissa’s comments on Feb. 27. The&nbsp;<i><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Real&nbsp;Housewives of Beverly Hills</a>&nbsp;</i>star shared an Instagram of herself wearing a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pink mini dress</a>, and a fan said in the comments section that she was lying about taking Ozempic, claiming that Kyle’s “fellow Housewives have told on you.” That’s when Kyle brought Melissa into the conversation, telling the fan, “This is not true. MY fellow Housewives never said such a thing. Another Housewife from a different franchise, aka Melissa, stated she assumed I was but then texted an apology to me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Melissa-Gorga-Slams-Rumors-Kyle-Richards-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>On so many occasions, Kyle has explained that she lost weight from cutting out <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>alcohol, sugar and carbs</a>, and not from using Ozempic, a Type 2 diabetes medication often abused to lose weight. During her Jan. 19 Amazon Live session, the Bravo star listed her exercise routine before <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>taking aim at the gossip</a>. “Like I said, [I do not use] Ozempic or that other one that starts with an M,” she noted. “I changed my eating after we were in Europe for a month. We were in Europe for three weeks and then Australia for a week, and I had gained weight, and I was like, ‘Okay, that’s it. No sugar, no carbs, no alcohol.’ ”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Kyle also <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>detailed her&nbsp;daily fitness routine</a> when she spoke to HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY on Feb. 1. “I&nbsp;work out every day. I’m usually in the gym for about two hours a day,” she said. “Actually, I do a lot of cardio. It’s really, really important for women to exercise and to eat right. I can’t stress that enough.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH10e49qZqadnJ7AtK2MoKarn5Fisaa6yJ6qZqqloryzecqyo55lop6wqa3Rnapmp6qaurG1wmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aviva-drescher-leg-throw-was-not-planned-and-im-not-sorry.html><span>←</span><span>Leg Throw Was NOT Planned!
