In 2010, when she was 19 years old, she became pregnant with her first son, <strong>Isaac Rivera</strong>. Her struggles with pregnancy and the first months of motherhood were documented by MTV on the second season of 16 & Pregnant. Later that same year, she was cast in the spinoff <a href=#>Teen Mom 2</a>, which followed her relationships, family drama, career, and the birth of her three other children. She’s now one of the most famous faces of the Teen Mom franchise.</p><h2><strong>Career:&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-2>It all began with 16 & Pregnant. Kailyn was a senior in high school when her then-boyfriend, <strong>Jo Rivera</strong>, got her pregnant. Matters were even further complicated by the fact that she had a strained relationship with her mother, and an absentee father. Her struggles through pregnancy and living with Jo’s family played out <a href=#>on MTV</a>, and she gave birth to their son, <strong>Isaac Elliot Rivera</strong>, on January 18, 2010. That same year, she was picked for the cast of the follow-up series <a href=#>Teen Mom 2</a>, where she met co-stars <strong>Jenelle Eason</strong>, <strong>Chelsea DeBoer</strong>, <strong>Leah Messer</strong>, and later, <strong>Briana DeJesus</strong>. She has appeared in all eight seasons of the dramatic reality series.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>During her decade on Teen Mom 2, Kailyn has written <a href=# rel=nofollow>five</a> New York Times best-selling books: A Letter of Love, an apology to her children for not giving them the “ideal family”; memoir Hustle and Heart, which she also turned into a companion adult coloring book; Pride Over Pity, another memoir detailing the “dark secrets” of her past; and the children’s book Love is Bubblegum. Kailyn has a YouTube channel called <a href=# rel=nofollow>Kail and Chaos</a>, that shows you what you don’t see on Teen Mom 2, and a popular podcast called <a href=#>Coffee Convos</a>, co-hosted by <strong>Lindsie Chrisley</strong>.</p><h2><strong><span class=celeb_profile_label>Personal Life:</span></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Kailyn has documented her tumultuous love life for 10 seasons (and counting) on Teen Mom 2. Kailyn and her high school boyfriend, Jo, split when their son was still a baby. She quickly moved on with <strong>Jordan Wenner</strong>, later revealing in Pride Over Pity that she actually cheated on Jo with him. After splitting with Jordan, she met <strong>Javi Marroquin</strong>, the man who would later become her husband.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Her relationship with Javi was full of drama. The two met in 2012 and moved in together just months after they started dating. Soon after, they were engaged, and married within the year. They celebrated with a big wedding later while Kailyn was pregnant with their son, <strong>Lincoln Marroquin</strong>. Their marriage hit a rough patch in 2015 when Kailyn suffered a miscarriage, which sparked problems — Kailyn said she felt Javi “blamed” her for losing the baby. She filed for divorce while he was deployed overseas with the Air Force, and the split was finalized in 2016 — but not before they went on Marriage Boot Camp together. She said on Coffee Convos in 2019 that she would “never” marry him again if given the chance, but they still amicably co-parent.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>An on-again, off-again relationship with her University of Delaware classmate <strong>Chris Lopez</strong> resulted in two more sons for Kailyn: <strong>Lux Lowry</strong>, who was born in 2017, and <strong>Creed Lopez</strong>, born in 2020. Kailyn told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> <a href=#>EXCLUSIVELY</a> in August 2020 that she “struggled” when Chris’ aunt leaked their pregnancy news by posting a sonogram on Instagram, and that she no longer has “any type of communication” with her ex, who has “barely” seen their son since his July birth.</p><h2>The Most Popular Questions About Kailyn Lowry</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>How Much is Kailyn Lowry’s Net Worth?</strong></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Aside from starring on the MTV show, Kailyn co-hosts a podcast and has written a children’s book, Pride Over Pity, which landed on the New York Times bestseller list.
