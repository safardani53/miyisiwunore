To hang on to your favorite equipment longer, upgrading them is the best method.</p><p>To do this, you must first complete "The Helm of Urtkot" quest by Hogsmeade and "The Elf, the Nab-Sack, and the Loom" quest in the <a href=#>Room of Requirement</a>. Finishing the quests will unlock the Enchanted Loom, which you can conjure in the Room of Requirement.</p><p>Interact with the Enchanted Loom to start upgrading gear items. But keep in mind: Upgraded gear will increase the opposite of its primary stat. For instance, equipment providing mostly defense will receive an offensive stat.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Avalanche Studios</span></figure><p>Unfortunately, Low-rarity equipment cannot get upgraded with the Enchanted Loom.</p><p>If you have a Superb-rarity gear item, you can even apply <a href=#>traits</a> obtained from challenges and bandit camps to tweak <a href=#>spells</a> or increase your character's durability. Upgradable gear can only get boosted three times and require various materials each step of the way.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Collect beast materials from the Vivarium and shops in order to upgrade your gear.</h2><p>Beast materials are items essential for upgrading gear in Hogwarts Legacy.
