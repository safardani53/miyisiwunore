They caught it just in time,” the reality star said. “They put me on a magnesium drip, and I just had all of these drugs getting pumped into my body. I was, like, worried it was going to affect [Summer]. It was just a lot at once.”</p><p>Her fiancé, <strong>Brock Davies</strong>, chimed in that they didn’t “realize … until after the fact” how much danger Shay was in at first. “We looked back, like, ‘Wait, that’s where this could have gone,’” the Aussie, 31, told Us while promoting his <a href=# rel=noopener>HOMEBODY</a> app. “It was definitely scary.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Scheana-Shay-and-Brock-Davies-Are-Considering-Surrogacy-or-Adoption-for-2nd-Baby.jpg><p>The personal trainer added that they feel “blessed” to live in a medically advanced time with multiple options for conceiving their second child together.</p><p>The former rugby player is also the father of two children from a previous relationship.

It’s still been a lot to process.”</p><p>By October 2020, the Azusa Pacific University grad was <a href=#>pregnant with her rainbow baby</a>. Since Summer’s April arrival, Shay has praised Davies’ parenting skills via Instagram, calling him an “amazing, hands-on loving” dad.</p><p>Not only has Davies been hard at work raising the little one, but he explained to Us on Monday that he’s been growing his career as well.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After doing Instagram Live and Zoom workouts amid the coronavirus pandemic, he decided to transition to HOMEBODY, a more “efficient, premium, clean platform” for connecting and exercise, which is designed for creators to monetize their content. “We wanted to have a high-quality live class,” Davies told Us. “We can connect [people] with creatives [they] want to go ahead and work out with [or] influencer celebrities.”</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGasm5iarq%2BtjKyfmrFdl7%2Bwr8pmm5qumZrAbq3RnmScp56otqWx0aKloGWjqr%2Bzu8aamrJlkZm8scDIqKVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./toy-story-controversy.html><span>←</span><span>No, Woke Culture Does Not Want Woody Removed From 'Toy Story'</span></a>
