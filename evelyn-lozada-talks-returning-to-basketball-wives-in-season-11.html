I didn’t know a lot about reality TV, but I owned a shoe store at the time and I was like, ‘oh, this is going to be great for the store,’” she explains. “I didn’t know that stepping into this would kind of just take over.”</p><p>After nine seasons, Lozada stepped away from Basketball Wives in 2021. “Reality TV could be a little draining, and I just felt like I needed a minute to recenter myself,” the mom of two ­— who shares daughter Shaniece, 30, with <strong>Jamal Hairston</strong> and <a href=#>son Carl Jr., 9, with ex <strong>Carl Crawford</strong></a> — explains, noting that during her absence, she focused on her family and businesses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Evelyn-Lozada-Looks-Back-On-Long-Running-Reality-TV-Career-3.jpg><p>The TV personality also looked for love on Queens Court — “a totally different experience” than the VH1 series, she says — alongside <a href=#><strong>Tamar Braxton</strong></a> and <strong>Nivea.</strong> Though she sparked up a romance with contestant <strong>Lavon Lewis</strong>, <a href=#>she exclusively told Us</a> last month that the pair called off their engagement.</p><p>After spending some time away from the Basketball Wives spotlight, Lozada agreed to return for season 11. Of course, jumping back into the lion’s den was daunting: “The first couple of weeks, it hit me [like] a ton of bricks — like, OK, I’m back in this,” she admits.</p><p>One of the perks of rejoining the series was reuniting with her former costars <strong>Jackie Christie</strong>, <strong>Brooke Bailey</strong> and <strong>Jennifer Williams</strong>.</p><p>Making amends with Williams — a longtime friend who Lozada previously feuded with — was “a big deal” for the Living Lozada alum. “I didn’t want to come onto the show arguing anymore, so we had a great conversation before filming,” she shares, noting viewers will see how the pair address their issues this season. “There was a lot of hurt and pain there [but] I’m happy that our friendship is back.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Evelyn-Lozada-Looks-Back-On-Long-Running-Reality-TV-Career-2.jpg><p>Lozada tells Us season 11 turned out to be one for the books. “Every week, I was like, oh my God, wait a minute, what happened? I was so invested because some of the stuff you couldn’t even make up,” she says, teasing a yet-to-be-aired cast trip also proved to be eventful. “It was a lot, but it was good.”</p><p>Though Lozada and her fellow Basketball Wives castmates are no strangers to drama, she says there’s nothing but love: “At the end of the day, whether we argue or not, we’re on the same team no matter what.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Evelyn-Lozada-Looks-Back-On-Long-Running-Reality-TV-Career-1.jpg><p>After more than a decade on television, Lozada knows which moment from Basketball Wives she would take back: A scene from season 4 when she threw a bottle at <strong>Kenya Bell</strong>. “I could have really hurt her,” she explains. As for which one she is most proud of? “We did an event for Domestic Violence Foundation this season. When I do anything in connection to my foundation, it’s something that really feeds my soul, and you can learn something from it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite any drama that has unfolded during her time on the small screen, Lozada is grateful for every moment. “It hasn’t always been positive, but it’s been a good experience,” she adds. “You have to get smart and you have to get the most out of the craziness.”</p><p>Basketball Wives airs Mondays on VH1 at 9 p.m.. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJyvnZyuu264zrOYnZldqa6tt9JmqZ6spae7qrrGZquoZZKWwKyx05uYpaRdrLa3sdJmoKdlo5qutLvNZmhqZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ashley-del-mundos-boyfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Ashley del Mundos Boyfriend: Who is Ashley del Mundo Dating?</span></a>
