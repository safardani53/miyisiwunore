Jordan Death Prank</h1></header><section class=post-content><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Angela-Bassetts-Son-Apologizes.jpg><p>Owning his mistake. Slater Vance,<a href=#> <strong>Angela Bassett</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Courtney B. Vance</strong></a>‘s 16-year-old son, apologized for pranking his parents by falsely claiming <a href=#><strong>Michael B. Jordan</strong></a> died.</p><p>“I apologize to Michael B. Jordan’s entire family, his extended family, and him directly as he is an idol of mine,” Slater <a href=#>said in a clip</a> posted on Saturday, December 31, hours after he shared and deleted the initial prank video. “Taking part in a trend like this is completely disrespectful. I don’t wish any bad ramifications upon his family nor my parents as they deserve none of the backlash.”</p><p>In Slater’s since-deleted video, he participated in a TikTok trend where children tell their parents their favorite celebrities are dead. The teen pretended to read a headline announcing the Creed star’s death at age 35. Bassett, 64, placed her hand over her heart in shock, repeating “uh-uh” in disbelief. Courtney, 62, told his son: “Stop it. You’re playing.”</p><p>The backlash was swift because Jordan isn’t just a celebrity the family admires. He’s a personal friend who starred in the 2018 and 2022<a href=#> Black Panther </a>movies with Bassett. Two years ago, the family <a href=#>mourned the tragic death</a> of Black Panther actor <a href=#>Chadwick Boseman</a>. The South Carolina native, who played the titular Marvel superhero, died at age 43 in August 2020 after secretly battling colon cancer. He is survived by wife Simone Boseman.</p><p>“I own this was a mistake,” Slater, who is a musician, said in his apology while seemingly holding back tears. “I hope this can be a teaching lesson to anyone who uses social media as a tool and a source of entertainment to truly understand that your actions can have consequences that extend beyond you.”</p><p>Bassett and Courtney have not addressed the post directly, but they shared a joint post via Instagram on Sunday, January 1. The family photo included Slater and twin sister <a href=#>Bronwyn</a>.</p><p>“Happy New Year from our family to yours! May ALL your dreams come TRUE & ALL your blessings OVERFLOW!” the couple, who married in 1997, captioned the family snap.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Jordan has also not addressed the scandal, but he was <a href=#>spotted alive and well</a> on New Year’s Eve at an English Premiere League soccer match. The Friday Night Lights alum watched the AFC Bournemouth game in Bournemouth, England, his first in-person game since becoming a minority shareholder of the team.</p><p>Just in case anyone was worried about rumors of his demise, he also posted via Instagram Story on Monday, January 2. “Whole squad locked in,” he captioned a behind-the-scenes photo from Creed 3, which will be his directorial debut. The film is set to hit theaters March 3.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaappeauaJ5wZqqrJ2kqcBuv86nZJqon6G8qLXZnqpmnp%2Bneq61wqGYnqRdl3qru9GdmKdllJqutbSMqamapptk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zienna-eve-sonne-williams.html><span>←</span><span>Zienna Eve Sonne Williams Biography</span></a>
