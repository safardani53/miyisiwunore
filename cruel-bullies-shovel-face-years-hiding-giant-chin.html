I'd been waiting a long time for it and I just wanted to get it over and done with.</p><p>"As soon as they told me I had an underbite, it was in my head, like, 'oh god, I've got this problem', and then it got worse and worse.</p><p>"I received comments from people all the time. People would call me 'shovel face', which sounds awful, and I would get bullied for it," she said.</p><p>Because of the condition, Jordan said she was never able to let herself go in public, as she had constantly been trying to hide it.</p><p>"I never fully felt confident in myself because I was always thinking that I couldn't show it [the underbite].</p><p>"The comments did affect me, but I wanted to get the surgery done for me as well, because they said it was going to get worse, and that eating would become a bit of a struggle too.</p><p>"It has definitely been a confidence boost. Now I can go out and smile with my teeth, which I've never been able to do before," she added.</p><p>Jordan had the surgery done at The Grange University Hospital in Cwmbran, South <a href=#>Wales</a>, and says that 10 months on, she's finally able to like how she looks in the mirror.</p><p>The beauty lover claims that the results from the surgery have made her feel like she can 'be herself', and now enjoys socialising with her family and friends.</p><h2>'PEOPLE SAY I LOOK GOOD'</h2><p>Jordan said: "At the start I looked really swollen, but now everything is really positive.</p><p>"I look in the mirror and I like what I see. It is me, and it's not. When you've looked at yourself for 21 years and then you look in the mirror [after surgery], it is different.</p><p>"I would definitely recommend this to other women who might feel similar.</p><p>"At the start, I felt like this didn't look like me, but I think it is just a process that you've got to go through.</p><p>"People say I look so good for it, and some say I look so much better for it. It's just really nice comments.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"I can just be myself.
