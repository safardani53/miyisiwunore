However, the exact location of her hometown and the whereabouts of her parents are still under review.</p><p>Further, it is questionable whether she is an only child or not. On the other hand, we know that Danyelle attended <strong>Florida State University</strong>.</p><p>While at the University, the American majored in Bachelor of Science in Communications.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FOQ6i-ZWYAMax2E.jpg></p><p>In the same way, upon graduation, the Georgia native worked as a production assistant for <strong>CNN</strong>, particularly for <strong>CNN Sports Illustrated</strong>.</p><p>Additionally, Danyelle burst into the sportscasting field less than five years after her first gig, one of which was anchoring.</p><p><strong>You might be interested in reading:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>&lt;&lt;Amanda Busick Bio: Personal life, career & FOX Sports>></a></strong></p><h2>How Tall Is Danyelle Sargent? Age, Height, & Body Measurements&nbsp;</h2><p>Currently, Sargent is 45 years old.</p><p>Social media pictures suggest; otherwise. She looks nothing like a 40-year-old, still vibrant and beautiful like a 25-year-old.</p><p>Although the secret to her beauty might be her workout regime, Mrs. Musselman maintained her youthful glow even after a decade-long hectic job schedule.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/EnMy-gXXMAIseP6.jpg></p><p>Furthermore, the sports reporter shares inspiring videos of her fitness routine on Instagram. Contrarily, we are unaware of her height and body measurements.</p><p>In assumptions, the beauty queen stands somewhere around <strong>1.76 m</strong> because she is taller than her husband, as evident from some Instagram posts.</p><p>Additionally, Mrs. Musselman has a lean yet slightly muscular physique, resulting from her rigorous routine at the gym and other outdoor activities.</p><p>The most distinguishing feature of Danyelle is her afro hairdo, smiling face, and muscly frame.</p><p><strong>Don’t forget to check out: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&lt;&lt;Lauren Gardner Bio: Husband, Career, DAZN, Net Worth, Instagram Wiki >></a></strong></p><h2>Danyelle Sargent Career | Sports Reporter</h2><p>To begin with, the Georgi born traveled a few hundred miles to the south, towards the state of Florida, to obtain her educational credentials.</p><p>After that, she moved back and immediately started working at <strong>WGXA</strong>, located in <strong>Macon</strong>, <strong>Georgia</strong>.</p><p>In all honesty, you need to give props to the people working in media, typically anchors and journalists.</p><p>They have to report news in the rawest form without exhibiting any form of <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>bias or emotions.</a></strong></p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Danyelle-Sargents-reporting-1024x576.jpg></p><p>For instance, keeping a straight face while a camera captures every moment and doing the same thing day and night is overwhelming.</p><p>Before joining <strong>ESPN</strong>, the African-American worked for Metro Sports, a sports channel produced by<strong> Time Warner Cable</strong>.</p><p>In the same way, the reporter remained in Kansas City-based network company for two years in <strong>2002</strong>.</p><p>After that, the network assigned Danyelle as a sideline reporter for the <strong>Kansas City Chiefs</strong> throughout the <strong>2004 </strong>preseason.</p><p>The following year, Ms. Sargent proudly stood as a co-emcee at the <strong>NCAA </strong>woman of the year awards. Similarly, the American gladly helmed the role yet again in 2006.</p><h3>ESPN</h3><p>Moving on, <strong>ESPN </strong>was monitoring Danyelle’s situation at Metro Sports.</p><p>Simultaneously, ESPN sought viable candidates for the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>ESPNEWS channel</a></strong> and identified Sargent as a worthy addition.</p><p>However, her stay at ESPN wasn’t devoid of controversy.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Danyelle-Sargent-ESPN.jpg></p><p>In one instance, a technical difficulty caused Danyelle’s voice to be taped over a live broadcast, and the audience heard the American cursing on national tv.</p><p>Nonetheless, the situation got shrugged off and became a blooper for the news network to joke about in the future.</p><p>Granted that Sargent had an enjoyable ESPN experience, the network decided to part ways with her after the contract expired in 2006.</p><p><strong>You might also be interested in reading:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Kent Tekulve’s Bio: Early Life, MLB, Broadcasting & Net Worth</a>.</strong></p><h3>FOX Sports</h3><p>Eventually, the talented reporter worked at FOX Sports and debuted on FSN Final Score in late 2006.</p><p>Also, Danyelle appeared in the segment’s taped version in July 2011. It seems that minor controversies follow wherever you go.</p><p>To illustrate, on October 26, 2008, when working as a sideline reporter, Sargent interviewed San Francisco 49ers’ coach <strong>Mike Singletary.</strong></p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Danyelle-Sargent-as-a-Sportscaster.png></p><p>At that moment, the FOX reporter asked what it meant for Mike to be the head coach and what the phone calls with his mentor<strong> Bill Walsh</strong> entailed.</p><p>Unbeknownst to her, <strong>Bill Walsh</strong> passed a year ago, so the interview was suddenly cut off.</p><h3>Comedy Central, Yahoo, & NFL Network</h3><p>Notwithstanding only a real-time job, Danyelle portrayed a fictional version of a sportscaster named <strong>Melissa Wells</strong> that premiered on Comedy Central’s <strong>Onion SportsDome</strong>.</p><p>In the dawn of 2012, the former sportscaster covered college football, NFL, NASCAR, Fantasy Football, and high school drafts during her time with Yahoo! Sports.</p><p>Similarly, NFL Network recruited Sargent as an anchor until April 2013.</p><h2>Danyelle Sargent Net Worth | Salary & Incomes</h2><p>According to various sources, Ms. Sargent accrued a net worth of around <strong>$500k</strong> to <strong>$1 million</strong>.</p><p>Nonetheless, it is tough to pinpoint her financial statistics as they are kept confidential.</p><p>On the contrary, <strong>Eric Musselman,</strong> Danyelle’s husband, collected a staggering net worth of <strong>$10-$15 million</strong> from his stints as a former basketball player and currently through coaching.</p><p>Despite this, figurative monthly earnings are not available at the moment.</p><p>Besides, NevadaSportsNet reported that the Arkansas Razorbacks coach would pocket a hefty <strong>$12.5 million</strong> from a new contract deal.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FG5r4Y4X0AE_SIf-819x1024.jpg></p><p>Thus, life seems comfortable for Musselman. In like manner, Danyelle’s stepsons are almost old enough to have a professional career.</p><p>That said, Dad Musselman and Mom Mussleman live a fulfilled lifestyle, occasionally do charitable work, and travel to exotic locations.</p><p>Besides, Mrs. Musselman doesn’t live an ideal life even after retirement.</p><p>After her TV gig, the beauty queen became a local celebrity of some sort, and one can spot her in Full Pedal Cycling Studio.</p><p>In the meantime, the former reporter promotes and endorses several local organizations and actively participates in tackling various social issues.</p><p>Moreover, Sargent appears in fundraisers and charity venues actively supporting<strong> Nevada Children’s Cancer Foundation</strong>&nbsp;and has affiliations with Pinocchio’s<strong> Moms on the Run</strong> to tackle breast Cancer.</p><h2>Danyelle Sargent Relationship Status | Who is Danyelle Sargent’s Husband?</h2><p>As mentioned above, Ms. Sargent is a happily married woman.</p><p>Accordingly, the FOX Sports reporter tied the knot to the renowned college basketball coach Eric Musselman sometime in September 2009.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/camila-816.jpg></p><p>Indeed, the couple found a blessing in their daughter <strong>Mariah, born</strong>&nbsp;in <strong>2010</strong>.</p><p>Notwithstanding that, Danyelle is equally proud to be a stepmom to <strong>Michael</strong> and <strong>Matthew,</strong> Eric’s sons from a previous marriage.</p><p>As <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Gisele Bundchen</strong> </a>once coined the term “<strong>Bonus Mom</strong>,” Sargent adheres to that term and doesn’t consider Michael and Matthew as stepchildren but as her own.</p><p>Likely so, the boys are glad to receive a motherly figure.</p><h3>Mariah Musselman: Also a Sports anchoring Geek</h3><p>Mariah Musselman is very much interested in sports anchoring like her mother.</p><p>She loves the mic and is fond of facing the camera. She recently interviewed her Father, Eric Musselman.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mariah-Musselman-interviewing-her-father.jpg></p><p>With a Father brilliant in basketball coaching and an excellent sports anchor like her mother, Mariah was born with the genes that drew her towards sports.</p><h2>Social Media Presence:</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram: </a><strong>21.4</strong><strong>k </strong>followers</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter: &nbsp;</a><strong>47.2K</strong> followers</p><p>Facebook:<strong> 2.7k </strong>friends</p><h2>Danyelle Sargent | Popularity</h2><p>People keep searching for Danyelle over the internet as she and her husband have earned fans.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Danyelle-Sargent-Pupularity-in-the-US.jpg></p><p>The above graph demonstrates the Google Search Volume of Danyelle for the last year worldwide.</p><h2>Some FAQs:</h2><h3>What is Danyelle Sergent’s Nationality?</h3><p>Danyelle Sergent is American by Nationality and belongs to the Black ethnicity.</p><h3>Who is Eric Musselman’s first wife?</h3><p>Eric Musselman’s first wife was Wendy Bauer.
