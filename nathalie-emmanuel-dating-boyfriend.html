She rarely talks about her relationships and family with her fans and followers. Emmanuel has been dating her boyfriend, Alex Lanipekun, since 2018 but not many people know about it.
This is because Emmanuel has never talked about being in a relationship or dating her partner. She has never revealed the identity of her partner on social media as well.
 Since her social media, especially Instagram, does not hint at her having a boyfriend or being in a relationship, many have assumed that she is single."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
