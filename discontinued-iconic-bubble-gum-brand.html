While you may still be able to score some on sites like eBay, good luck finding them for the spare change you used to pay.
Long gone are the days of paying a quarter for a pack as nostalgia has tacked on a fee."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

CHICLETS</h2><p>The Chiclets brand was discontinued back in 2016 although it still remains a mystery as to why.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Discontinued Items">Read More on Discontinued Items</h2><p>After leaving, the brand decided to offer fans Chiclet Chews.</p><p>While they look nearly identical, they are definitely different.</p><p>While the gum has been long gone, some fans are just noticing its disappearance.</p><p>One Chiclets lover said on Twitter: “Omg deep memory of mine that I just remembered- Chiclets gum?! Why was it discontinued it was so good.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>For the diehards looking to score some more before they are gone forever, they can head to <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">eBay and purchase</a> a pack.</p><h2>2. BEECHIES</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/NA-DiscontinuedGum-02jpg-JS805965861.jpg><p>Another popular gum brand, Beechies, was similar to Chiclets in looks and flavor.</p><p>While it was first introduced back in the 1930s, it really took off in the 80s and had at least 10 flavors.</p><p>Fans could grab it in Grape, Cola, Banana, Strawberry, or Peppermint.</p><p>Unfortunately, fans can no longer grab the gum in stores but much like most things these today, it can be found online.</p><p>Just note that you’ll be paying a premium as some <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">sites are selling</a> it for upwards of $19.</p><h2>3. GATORGUM</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/NA-DiscontinuedGum-03jpg-JS805965859.jpg><p>Known for its sports drinks, Gatorade tried to break into the chewing gum game back in the 70s.</p><p>It may not have had the longest-lasting flavor, but the gum came in two classics: orange and lemon-lime.</p><p>While the Gatorade gum changed over the years, there was always some form for sale until the 2000s.</p><p>It’s not clear when the gum was actually discontinued as some fans say it was in the 80s and others claim they could still buy it up until the 2000s.</p><p>Either way, it’s long gone now and some fans are still crushed.</p><p>One Twitter user wrote: “Remember Gatorade gum? It was amazing!”</p><h2>4. BUBBLICIOUS</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/NA-DiscontinuedGum-06jpg-JS805965865.jpg><p>Probably one of the most notorious bubble gum brands is Bubblicious.</p><p>While fans can still grab some flavors, others have been missing for years.</p><p>Many have claimed that there have been at least 28 flavors and 10 of them have been discontinued.</p><p>Fans took to Twitter after they were shocked to find that the beloved Cotton Candy flavor was no longer stacked on shelves.</p><p>One fan wrote: “RIP to the best bubble gum flavors ever, Bubblicious Twisted Tornado and Bubble Yum Cotton Candy. IDK why both of them were discontinued, but years later my inner child aches for both.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Meanwhile, Kroger has <a href=#>confirmed it discontinued </a>its ‘best after school’ snack.</p><p>Plus, <a href=#>Arby's fans are boycotting</a> the chain until it brings back a fan favorite.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbIRzhZBvcGicmaiwsLrToqWunZRitqS7zaKaZpqll6%2BtsYygrKZlkqeur7CO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./florida-officials-clash-over-whether-to-lower-the-flag-for-rush-limbaugh.html><span>←</span><span>Florida Officials Clash Over DeSantis' Order to Lower Flag for Rush Limbaugh</span></a>
