She started writing songs on a $17 guitar her husband bought her and singing in honkytonks to make extra money.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1960, she signed her first record deal and released her first single, "I'm a Honky Tonk Girl." A string of Top 10 hits followed: "Don't Come Home A' Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind)," "You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man)," "Fist City." Many were inspired by her own marital woes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>For more on Loretta Lynn, listen below to our daily podcast PEOPLE Every Day.</a></strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I went through a lot and I put up with a lot," Lynn ‚Äî who joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1962 ‚Äî told PEOPLE in 2010. "Every song I wrote came from my heart."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Eric Ogden</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1972, Lynn became the Country Music Association's first female entertainer of the year, and in 2003, when she received the Kennedy Center Honor, President George H.W. Bush called her "a national treasure."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lynn's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>bestselling 1976 autobiography</a> Coal Miner's Daughter revealed her impoverished childhood in Butcher Hollow in painful detail. It also served as the basis of the 1980 box-office hit that won a Best Actress Oscar for its leading lady (who was Lynn's personal choice for the role), Sissy Spacek.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Today is a sad day. The world lost a magnificent human being. Loretta Lynn was a great artist, a strong and resilient country music pioneer and a precious friend," Spacek told PEOPLE in a statement. "I am heartbroken. I send my deepest sympathies to her wonderful family, her friends, and her loyal fans."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lynn remained an icon to her fans, peers and much younger artists, among them Jack White, who produced 2004's Van Lear Rose and considered Lynn "an absolute genius. She was the greatest female singer-songwriter of the 20th century." The album revived her career with glowing reviews and two Grammys.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lynn and "Doo" were married from 1948 until his death in 1996. They had six children, the eldest of whom, son Jack, died in a drowning accident in 1984. In 2013, daughter Betty Sue died of complications from emphysema. Of Lynn's seven siblings, the most famous is singer Crystal Gayle. Besides those survivors, Lynn also had several grandchildren.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Assessing what her legacy might be, Lynn told PEOPLE in 2010: "I really don't know that I've made a mark. I hope I have. And I hope I'm thought well of, that I never hurt nobody."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lynn was hospitalized in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2017 after suffering a stroke at her Hurricane Mills home. The country singer was also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hospitalized several times</a> in her life for exhaustion and pneumonia ‚Äî all the while continuing to tour concert halls and greet visitors to her ranch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Lynn was still not well enough to attend the preview party to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>celebrate her new exhibit</a> at the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum</a> in Nashville that August, she instead sent <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>her daughter</a>, Patsy Lynn Russell, off with what she called "a piece of me" ‚Äì the two wedding bands given to her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>by her late husband</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It took her so long to get one, I think he felt she deserved two," Russell said as she fingered the two identical bands, each studded with a row of small diamonds. "She took them off her finger and gave them to me today ‚Ä¶ It's kind of like she gets to go through [the exhibit] with me."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Loretta Lynn.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Michael Ochs Archives/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though Lynn was singing around the home again and back in conversation with her Sony label to release her new album after it was postponed because of the stroke, Russell said her mother's main challenge was regaining her balance. But her progress within the span of six weeks left her family optimistic about her speedy road to recovery.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The difference between then and now is night and day," said Lynn's grandson, Anthony Brutto, who summoned the ambulance for his grandmother after the stroke. "It's amazing to see the will and fire she has inside ‚Ä¶ Nothing can get her down, and nothing will get her down. ‚Ä¶ She's still witty. She's still very sharp. She's still very funny. When I went over there last week she said she's writing songs and playing the guitar, so it's really awesome to get to see that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lynn did everything it takes to get herself back on her feet for the ones she loves most. Her not-to-be-missed attendance at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Alan Jackson's</a> Country Music Hall of Fame induction that marked her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>first public appearance</a> in Nashville since her health crisis.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This is the first time I've been out of the house, Alan," Lynn said after being greeted with a raucous standing ovation by the 800 invited guests. "You're the only thing that've brought me here."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lynn had been making great strides in her recovery until she suffered a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>broken hip after a fall at her home</a> on Jan. 1, 2018.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She had an accident on New Year's Day and fractured her hip," Russell told PEOPLE exclusively about her mother's condition at the time. "At my mom's age it's so dangerous when it comes to the hip, so we're all just grateful she seems to be OK. She's up putting weight on it and starting her rehab now."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And it may have been caused by playing with her furry new friend.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She has a new puppy ‚Äî we don't really know if she was chasing after the puppy or what, but she slid and fractured her hip. We blame the puppy!" said Patsy with a laugh. "Though the puppy brings smiles so there's that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In September 2018, Lynn <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>opened up to PEOPLE about her health</a> ‚Äî and assured that no stroke was going to get her down: "I wasn't goin' to let it stop me. You just can't sit down and say 'Hey, take me.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later that week, she released <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wouldn't It Be Great</a>, an album of original songs along with a few remakes of old favorites like "Coal Miner's Daughter", which she had postponed due to her stroke.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's a very scary thing when you find out you're havin' a stroke," Lynn said at the time. Immediately, I wondered if I could sing. Mommy said I was born singin'. That's all I've ever done. I couldn't believe that that could be taken away."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Loretta Lynn.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Russ Harrington</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later, in June 2017, Lynn responded to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a tabloid report</a> that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>insinuated she was on her deathbed</a> in a video on her Facebook page. "Hey, this says I'm in a nursing home and I'm on my deathbed. You're kidding me! I'm not dead and neither is Willie! Both of us are coming back to life and we're gonna raise hell," she said, referencing fellow singer Willie Nelson, who refuted similar rumors in the past.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a 2019 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Lifetime biopic titled Patsy & Loretta</a>, fans followed the true story of Patsy Cline and Lynn ‚Äî and how they helped each other make their mark in the industry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The four-time Grammy winner released Still Woman Enough, her 50th studio album, in March 2021 and it served as a celebration of women in country music. The album featured <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Carrie Underwood</a>, Reba McEntire, Tanya Tucker, Margo Price and more.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-87 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whatever she endured at home, fans and fellow artists showered her with love. "She was beautiful and feisty and had this spirit that made you want to be better," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Miranda Lambert</a>, who spent time with Lynn, told PEOPLE.
