So, what happened exactly? She returns in a later episode and we have all the details.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fox</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Meghan on ‘Farmer Wants a Wife’?</h2><p>Tragedy struck in the April 12, 2023 episode of Fox’s rural reality series.

However, Hunter offered unconditional support for her desire to go home.</p><p>When speaking to the cameras, Meghan admitted that her late grandfather would have truly enjoyed Hunter’s company.</p><p>“I always take people home to meet my grandfather first. That’s who they meet. And so I’m really sad he didn’t get to meet Hunter,” the reality star said. “Because I feel like [Hunter and I] made a genuine connection.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fox</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Meghan returns on ‘Farmer Wants a Wife’ after leaving the show.</h2><p>After sharing the news of her grandfather’s passing with the other Farmer Wants Wife contestants, Meghan and Hunter said a tearful goodbye. However, in the April 26, 2023 episode of Farmer Wants a Wife, Meghan returns. And just like, her cowgirl hat is thrown back into the ring for Hunter's heart. She even reveals that her grandmother approved of her return.</p><p>When Meghan shows up at Hunter's ranch while he's in the middle of an activity with the other ladies, he stops what he's doing and nearly runs across a field to greet Meghan. It's clear that all of Hunter's feelings for Meghan are still here and the other ladies can see it too.</p><p>When a producer asks Hunter's other frontrunner DeVonne Ryter if she's excited to see Meghan, she gives a tight-lipped smile and a very non-convincing agreement.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Meghan Baker✨ (@meghanbaker1)</a></p></figure><p>Clearly, though, there are no hard and fast rules about a contestant returning on Farmer Wants a Wife.
