alley.</p><p>Four years later she began dating Gary, after he also got a job at the bowling alley, and the couple had three children together.</p><p>In March last year former Ukip councillor Searle invited Anastasia to his office for coffee and told her he had not had sex in six years.</p><p>He then asked if she "wanted to make him happy", the Mirror reports.</p><img

embarked on an affair for two months after Searle bombarded Anastasia with explicit texts and pictures from his bodybuilding days.</p><p>Anastasia said: "I felt dirty, I always had to have a shower straight after meeting him.”</p><p>Ipswich Crown Court heard yesterday how Anastasia had a son from a previous relationship who was a cadet in a troop Searle ran.</p><p>He even arranged regular illicit romps with his lover under the pretence of discussing the lad’s progress.</p><p>He nicknamed her SBG — short for Steve’s Beautiful Girl — and also ridiculed his wife of 45 years, calling her “a piece of s**t”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

Searle discovered explicit text messages and pictures exchanged between the pair.</p><p>She decided to stay with her husband because she believed she was too old to start again.</p><p>But the heavy-drinking couple argued at their £400,000 home on December 30 and Searle strangled his wife using a choke hold he learned in the military.</p><p>He denied murder, claiming he had acted in self-defence after she tried to stab him in the stomach with a steak knife.</p><p>But Searle was convicted after a seven-day trial, after a jury heard he told cops: “I’ve been a very naughty boy.”</p><p>Searle was warned<a href=#>&nbsp;he faces life in prison when he is sentenced later today.</a></p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">'I lost my mum and dad': Son of
