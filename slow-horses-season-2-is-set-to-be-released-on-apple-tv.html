<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Slow Horses Season 2 Is Set To Be Released On Apple TV+</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>While Apple TV+</strong> has previously stated that Slow Horses will return for a second season, the second season will release on December 2, 2022. Following the debut of the first and second episodes, the remaining episodes will be available on Apple TV+ on Fridays throughout December.</p><p>The program is based on the Slough House series of espionage novels by Mick Herron. The first season of the program is based on the first novel in the series, Dead Lion, which was released in 2013. The second season is based on the second book in the series, Dead Lion, which was published in 2013.</p><h2>It is worth mentioning that Olivia Cooke may not return for season 2.</h2><p>According to the show‚Äôs synopsis, Slow Horses follows a group of MI5 intelligence officers who have screwed up their careers. For the same reason, they were all dispatched to Slough House, MI5‚Äôs dumping ground, to do ‚Äúpaper-pushing chores.‚Äù</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Slow-Horses-1.jpg alt="Slow Horses" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The first season of the program has already laid the groundwork for its sequel, with Hassan living to see another day and Slough House free of any concerns or charges. Meanwhile, Di Taverner got away with his actions, and none of the important characters were killed. Sid Baker, on the other hand, was the only one who was shot and forced to vanish by MI5.</p><h2>Is there anything revealed in the Slow Horses trailer?</h2><p>The teaser for Season 2 implies that there will be a lot of high-level criminality and treachery. The crimes may be more harder for the Slough squad to solve since their lives and jobs are on the line. If the teaser for the second season of the series, which premiered in April 2022, is any indicator, viewers should anticipate nothing less than a roller coaster trip.&nbsp;Slow Horses Season 2 will feature the same six-episode format as Season 1.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Slow-Horses-2.jpg alt="Slow Horses" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>What does Slow Horses filmmaker James Hawes have to say about it?</h2><p>Slow Horses director James Hawes talked with Deadline and expressed relief that the performance received a great reaction from the audience. He said that he was astounded by the number of people who appreciated the series and its worldwide reach. He said that he has received positive feedback regarding the series from individuals all across the globe. As previously stated, the first two episodes of the series are already available on Apple TV+, and the remaining episodes will be published every Friday.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I‚Äôve watched a LOT of TV this year, but the show that surprised me most was <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#SlowHorses</a>.
