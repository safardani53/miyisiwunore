They provide exceptional care for beluga whales, and despite being amid the challenges of COVID-19, in May 2021, Mystic Aquarium took these five whales on for us to provide the world-class care and expertise they needed," the statement read. "This collaboration underscores the global community's shared responsibility for animal welfare. Marineland is deeply thankful for Mystic Aquarium's professionalism and tireless efforts in safeguarding the health and happiness of these beloved marine creatures."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After Havok died in 2021, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>U.S. Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) inspected Mystic Aquarium's care of its beluga whales and discovered issues that it reported to the facility. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>ABC News</a> reported that the aquarium made changes to address the USDA's findings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Seacor wrote in a statement to PEOPLE that Mystic Aquarium didn't agree with the USDA's 2021 findings but made adjustments based on the department's feedback.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We have had four inspections since early 2022, all without&nbsp;noncompliant&nbsp;findings (clean report).
