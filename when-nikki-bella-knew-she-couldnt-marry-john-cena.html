I feel so overwhelmed,” Nikki said to cameras. “I honestly feel like I’m about to have an anxiety attack. I just feel like I’m on this roller coaster of emotions and I feel like I’m going to explode. It’s just all too much for me.”</p><p>During the celebration, the couple made the announcement that they would be getting married in Napa Valley. After the WWE champion’s speech, <a href=#><strong>Brie Bella</strong></a> <a href=#>interjected to announce</a> that her and Nikki’s brother, JJ Garcia, and his wife, Lauren, were expecting their second baby.</p><p>That announcement inspired Nikki to reveal that not having a baby is what was holding her back from being excited about marrying Cena, who has been adamant about not wanting children. “I just know deep down I want a baby,” she said during a confessional. “I just, I guess, I don’t know. I want to be a mom and I feel like I can’t live the rest of my life not having one.”</p><p>Later in the episode, the pair had a tearful conversation about their future. “I don’t even know how to start except, um, I guess just like for some reason since Birdie’s been born and I’ve spent a lot of time with Birdie, it’s just brought up these feelings of<a href=#> really wanting to be a mom</a>. I don’t know if I would regret it later on in life if I wasn’t,” Nikki told Cena, 41. “I love you so much and I feel that has always been worth sacrificing for. I think just because we’re getting married and everything is so permanent. Not that it has made me feel suffocated, but it’s given me a bit of anxiety knowing that okay, the day 5/5 comes, like, that’s it. The mom thing is done.”</p><p>“I would never force you to not be a mom. I really want to say it’s a surprise, but I even told you this so many times this would happen,” Cena told her. “I’m not sure we should go through with this.”</p><p>But the actor may have had a change of heart. He appeared on the Today show earlier this month and made it clear that he was still not over Nikki. “For anyone out there speculating on what I am doing with my life now, I still love Nicole. I still would love to marry Nicole. I still <a href=#>would love to have a family</a> with Nicole,” Cena said. “I love her. I want to be with her. I want to make her my wife. I want to be the father of her children. I just want us to work.” The Blockers star also p<a href=#>osted an iconic photo of <strong>John Cusack</strong></a> holding a boombox from the 1989 romantic comedy Say Anything on Instagram, hinting that he wants his girl back.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Us Weekly broke the news in April that Nikki had <a href=#>called off her engagement</a> to Cena after six years together. The pair were supposed to tie the knot on May 5 in Mexico. The two have since been<a href=#> spotted together</a> in San Diego on May 19.</p><p>For the latest TV news and interviews subscribe to our new podcast ‘Watch With Us’ below plus listen and get $30 off your first order from Hello Fresh at <a href=#>hellofresh.com/WatchWithUs30</a><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6hnZ5iu6q3yqJkm52coa5ut82ermarmJp6pLvUpZunrF2irrO%2B2GahqKCeYrCmusBo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kathryne-padgett-5-things-to-know-about-alex-rodriguezs-friend.html><span>←</span><span>Kathryne Padgett: 5 Things to Know About Alex Rodriguez's Friend</span></a>
