Is that fair?</p><p>Below, we discuss the TikTok in question created by nurses at Ochsner Health.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ochsner Health nurses made a TikTok video to "Slut Me Out" by rapper NLE Choppa.</h2><p>In a now-deleted TikTok video, several Ochsner Health employees were seen performing a dance routine to NLE Choppa's 2022 hit "Slut Me Out," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NOLA.com</a>.</p><p>Their dance included several references to sexual acts, which at times incorporated using hospital equipment.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In addition to lip-syncing the vulgar track, the nurses also made obscene gestures with their hands and used hospital equipment to act out parts of the song.</p><p>There were at least five female nurses and two male nurses who appeared in the video. All were donning scrubs.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Furthermore, one woman in the video was seen wearing an LSU Nursing sweatshirt, suggesting that she's a student in the midst of completing her clinical trails.</p><p>Per the outlet, Ochsner executive vice president and chief administrative officer Tracey Schiro confirmed the video was filmed at one of its New Orleans facilities. In a prepared statement, she said that “we have investigated the situation and have taken appropriate actions with those involved in the video.”</p><p>It's unclear what actions the hospital took. But according to a Facebook user in the above post, they were terminated.</p><p>Ochsner Health is a not-for-profit health system with multiple locations in the New Orleans metropolitan area of southeast Louisiana.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Four Atlanta nurses were fired in December 2022 for creating a TikTok where they complained about their patients.</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>For context, TikTok's popular <a href=#>"ick" trend</a> started over two years ago. Basically, creators list traits that are cringe-y or unattractive to them (things that make them go "ick"). The trend is usually used to discuss dating pet peeves, but the nurses applied it to their patients.</p><p>"My ick is when you ask me how much the baby weighs and it’s still … in your hands," said one nurse. Other nurses shared how dads sometimes ask for a paternity test right outside the room their partner gave birth in. Or when patients don't use the call light button and send family members to fetch them instead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpLCpv82eqWampafApr%2BMn6CrnZRivLex0WaroqOkpLg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gia-casey-msyq-html.html><span>←</span><span>Gia Casey (Family Member) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
