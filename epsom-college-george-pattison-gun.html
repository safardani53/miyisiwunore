which had recently been updated, and a weapon registered in his name.</p><p>A firearm belonging to the dad was discovered with the family's bodies at their home on the grounds of the prestigious <a href=#>Epsom College</a>, <a href=#>Surrey</a>, in the early hours of Sunday.</p><p>Cops have not disclosed the cause of deaths but are treating the case as a <a href=#>double murder-suicide</a>.</p><p>George had been in contact with Surrey Police just days before the killings to change the address on his gun licence after the family moved to the school site from Caterham.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE UK NEWS">READ MORE UK NEWS</h2><p>The force said this was a "routine" formality, but due to how recently the update was made, the incident has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).</p><p>George had held the licence for several years and it was up for renewal early last year, according to <a href=# aria-label="The Times (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Times</a>.</p><p>The newspaper said he had not been reported to the police before, but in 2016 he had contacted them to allege that his wife had hit him, before withdrawing the claim.</p><p>The Pattison family were found dead at around 1.10am on February 5.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>Earlier that evening, Emma made a <a href=#>distress call to a relative</a> with concerns about her partner, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the BBC</a> reports.</p><p>By the time they arrived at the house, which is surrounded by other properties occupied by college staff and is close to the prestigious school's&nbsp;<a href=#>rifle range</a>, all three were dead.</p><p>A school worker living nearby is said to have raised the alarm after <a href=#>hearing suspected gunshots</a>.</p><p>Detective Chief Inspector Kimball Edey, senior investigating officer on the case, said: "This is an incredibly traumatic incident and we are working around the clock to investigate and understand the exact circumstances which led to this point."</p><p>Emma was only appointed headmistress at the £42,000-a-year boarding school five months ago.</p><p>She lived on-site with her daughter, Labrador puppy Bella and husband George, who ran a management consultancy firm called Tanglewood 2016, according to Companies House.</p><p>Despite moving to Epsom from their £1.5million property in Caterham last year, the Pattisons reportedly only recently finished transporting the last of their belongings.</p><p>Removal vans were spotted outside the four-bedroom detached home, where they had lived since 2014, in the last few weeks.</p><h2>'UNIMAGINABLE'</h2><p>The loss of the "much-loved" head and her "lovely" family has <a href=#>shaken the community</a>.</p><p>One former neighbour said: "It is just shocking and unimaginable."</p><p>Another described them as having "an obvious bond", while former colleagues and parents said Emma couldn't have been more committed to her job.</p><p>Dr Alastair Wells, chairman of the board of governors at Epsom College, said she was a "wonderful teacher" and "delightful person" who "enriched the lives of many pupils throughout the distinguished career".</p><p>Cheryl Giovannoni, chief executive of the Girls' Day School Trust (GDST) which runs Croydon High School where Emma used to work, said: "Emma was a much loved and respected member of the GDST community, as well as a talented Head and teacher, and a dear friend to many of us.</p><p>"She touched the lives of all of us with her energy, wisdom and kindness during her six years as Head of Croydon High School and the school will always bear the legacy of her inspiring leadership."</p><p>And Julie Keller, head at Nottingham Girls' High School said her life was "richer for having Emma as a friend and colleague".</p><p>"The world is certainly poorer for her loss," she added.</p><p>Emma was a talented head and teacher, and a dear friend to many of us.</p><span class=quote-credit>Cheryl Giovannoni</span><span class=quote-credit-meta>Girls' Day School Trust</span><p>Before Christmas,&nbsp;<a href=#>Emma</a>&nbsp;seemed&nbsp;<a href=#>enthusiastic about her future</a>&nbsp;at the elite school, which counts presenter&nbsp;<a href=#>Jeremy Vine</a>&nbsp;and ex-MI6 spy chief Sir John Scarlett as ex-pupils.</p><p>She excitedly told sixth form students that she couldn't wait to experience her first Founder's Day, pancake race and prize-giving ceremony.</p><p>Emma said: "I am absolutely loving my time here so far.</p><p>"It has been very, very busy, but absolutely wonderful.</p><p>"There is so much to look ahead to and be excited about."</p><p>But she also revealed that the new role had brought "really big changes" for her family.</p><p>"We’ve obviously moved house, we’ve got a dog, I’ve got a new job, my husband’s got a new job, which wasn’t meant to happen but did, and my daughter has started at a new school," Emma said.</p><p>The college is supporting students with chapel services and counselling, a spokesperson said.</p><p>Police remain on the scene while the area is forensically examined.</p><p>Changes were made to <a href=#>gun licensing systems</a> in the wake of shooting tragedies in Plymouth and West Sussex.</p><p>New digital markers were put in place to flag up to GPs relevant changes in patients with firearms licences who may be medically unfit to hold them.</p><h2

the UK?</h3></p><p>THE UK has some of the strictest gun laws in the world.</p><p>If you have the correct permit, you can own sporting rifles and shotguns.</p><p>You cannot buy a shotgun or ammunition until the age of 18.</p><p>But, people under the age of 18 can own an air weapon as long as they are supervised by a person over the age of 21.</p><p>People under 15 may be granted a shotgun certificate and may borrow a shotgun under supervision of a person who is over the age of 21.</p><p>Anyone who owns or uses a firearm in the UK needs to have an appropriate licence or certificate from their local police.</p><p>Firearms and shotgun certificates are valid for five years, after which they will have to be renewed.</p><p>You must also have a certificate to buy ammunition.</p><p>There are restrictions when it comes to physical or mental health conditions that could affect your ability to safely own and use a firearm.</p><p>This includes, for example, epilepsy, stroke, stress-related illness, depression, alcoholism, heart disease, cancer.</p><p>And you must not withhold information about any convictions when applying.</p><p>Local police forces must be satisfied that the applicant has good reason for having a weapon, they are fit to be entrusted with one, and public safety will not be endangered.</p><p class=postsid
