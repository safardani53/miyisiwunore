While the role earned her two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress in 2011 and 2012, the star, 51, had a hugely successful acting career long before the iconic ABC sitcom. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Julie would eventually take her theater experience from Brown University to Hollywood, where she immediately landed a role in the soap opera Loving in 1992. From there, it was a lead in Happy Gilmore as <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Adam Sandler’s</strong></a> love interest to recurring stints on Lost and Boston Legal. With all that experience, Julie decided to start her own production company, Bowen & Sons!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/julie-bowen-sisters-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Speaking of family, Julie has two sisters that are just as talented! Below, find out everything you need to know about <b>Molly Luetkemeyer </b>and<b> Annie Luetkemeyer</b>!</p><h2><strong><strong><b>All About Julie Bowen’s Sisters</b></strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Julie’s two sisters were also born in Baltimore. The three siblings were the only children of Suzanne Frey and John Alexander Luetkemeyer Jr., who worked as a commercial real estate developer. Molly (below) has dabbled in television as well! The younger sister of the actress was a host for the TLC show Clean Sweep.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Molly landed the fun gig because of her monumental success in interior design, which has exploded over the past two decades. After establishing M. Design Interiors in 2001, Molly has lent her talent to designing homes in Beverly Hills, Martha’s Vineyard, New York’s West Village, and other posh residences throughout the United States, according to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a>. She has been named The Hollywood Reporter‘s list of 25 Most Influential Interior Designers in LA and on&nbsp;House Beautiful‘s list of Top 100 Designers in America four times. Her Los Angeles abode even had it’s own feature in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2017 issue </a>of House Beautiful!</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Julie’s sister Annie took a very different path than her two older siblings, but she’s found phenomenal success as an infectious disease expert. Specializing in tuberculosis, HIV, and viral hepatitis as the Professor of Medicine and Infectious Diseases at the University of California, San Francisco, Annie first studied at Stanford and then went on to get her degree in medicine from Harvard. She has also recently turned her attention to the coronavirus pandemic, leading investigations into potential therapies for Covid-19.</p><h2><strong><strong><b>Julie and Annie’s Hero Moment</b></strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Julie and Annie made headlines in August 2021 when they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>helped rescue a hiker</a> in Utah’s Arches National Park. The two sisters were hiking when they came upon Minnie John, a New Jersey mother, who had fainted and broken her glasses. Minnie detailed the encounter on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Facebook</a>, saying she woke up to a familiar voice and wondered if she was watching television.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>After Julie and Annie treated Minnie with some bandages and electrolytes, Minnie said she couldn’t shake the feeling she knew one of her rescuers. “That face looked so familiar again and I asked her again if I knew her or was she famous and the doctor said yes,” Minnie wrote. “Her sister the doctor asked me to guess and I told her I just hit my head, I can’t remember. She said smiling Modern Family and I said of course!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Julie and Annie then explained to Minnie that their hiking guide had seen Minnie fall flat on her face, which prompted the sisters to run to Minnie’s side. They assured Minnie she was going to be fine and then used her cell phone to call her son, who was about twenty minutes ahead on the hike, to let him know what had happened. Minnie wrote that she fainted because she is diabetic and her “sugar was low.” After being taken to a hospital, she discovered she had fractured her nose and received five stitches. “They were so caring and loving to stop like the Good Samaritan does in the Bible,” she said of Julie and Annie. “They were God sent! It was no accident they were there.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8muo6KdXZe8uLHNZqqiq6Sav26AlWlucHFjZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-dawnchere-wilkerson-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Dawnchere Wilkerson Dating Now</span></a>
