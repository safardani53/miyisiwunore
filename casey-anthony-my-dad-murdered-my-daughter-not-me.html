She would never even leave my room without telling me. I immediately started looking around the house.

He handed her to me. Said it was my fault. That I caused it. But he didn’t rush to call 911 and he wasn’t trying to resuscitate her. I collapsed with her in my arms. She was heavy, and she was cold.”</p><p>Casey also blames George for the fact that no one in the family contacted authorities until 31 days after Caylee’s death.</p><p>She insists that throughout that entire month, she “genuinely believed that Caylee was still alive.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/casey-anthony-leaves-jail-in-florida-1024x794.jpg><p>“My father kept telling me she was ok. I had to keep following his instructions. He told me what to do. I tried to act as normal as I could,” Anthony claims.</p><p>Casey also says that she does not believe her father’s claim that Caylee drowned accidentally.</p><p>She explains that it would have been impossible for the two-year-old to scale the sides of the aboveground pool without assistance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“There was no ladder…no way for her to shimmy up.
