What's the story behind his title of lord? Here's what we know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There's a not so glamorous story behind Scott's title of lord.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@letthelordbewithyou</a></figure><p>The genesis of Scott's honorary title can be traced back to the playful and somewhat eccentric nature of the reality TV star. In a memorable episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Scott, known for his cheeky antics, declared his aspirations for royalty.</p><p>"Whether it's Sir Disick, Lord Disick, Count Disick — becoming royal is going to get me the respect I deserve," he proclaimed. I mean the man's Instagram handle is literally, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@letthelordbewithyou</a>.</p><p>The twist is that Scott didn't ascend to his noble status through traditional means. Instead, he purchased the title online, adding a touch of irony to his newfound aristocracy.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">People can get the title of lord three different ways.</h2><p>While Scott's method of acquiring a lordship isn't exactly fancy, it's worth exploring the various legitimate ways one can obtain such a title. Traditionally, titles like lord or lady are hereditary or granted by the monarch for notable contributions.</p><p>However, in the modern era, companies such as Highland Titles offer individuals the opportunity to purchase novelty titles, allowing them to playfully adopt the mantle of nobility. Also, marrying into a family with existing titles or appointment to the House of Lords, one of the chambers of the U.K. Parliament, are other avenues through which one can acquire such distinctions.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Just because Scott is a lord, doesn't mean his kids are royalty.</h2><p>Even though Scott named one of his kids Reign, the royal status he purchased doesn't bestow any royal status upon his children. In the world of reality TV and celebrity culture, playful titles and eccentric declarations aren't uncommon.</p><p>While<strong> </strong>his three children — Mason, Penelope, and Reign — are certainly reality TV royalty, they aren't legitimate members of a royal family. The line between fantasy and reality in the Kardashian universe is often blurred, and Scott's title is just another facet of the family's penchant for dramatic flair.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@letthelordbewithyou</a></figure><p>So, there you have it — the whimsical tale of how Scott, the charismatic maverick of the Kardashian clan, became "Lord Disick." Whether it's through online purchases, noble lineage, or parliamentary appointments, the world of titles and distinctions is far more diverse than one might imagine. And we can’t wait to see what crazy antic Scott will think of next!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZKybn6nBbrDIrKCco12Yrq24xJ1kpaeimQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mom-killed-2-kids-injured-after-roommate-attacks-them-with-hammer-in-new-york-city-7852222.html><span>←</span><span>Mom Killed, 2 Kids Injured After Roommate Attacks Them with Hammer</span></a>
