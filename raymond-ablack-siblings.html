In addition to playing Padma, Rebecca also appears in <a href=#>Luckiest Girl Alive</a>.</p><p>Raymond actually spilled the beans on the two actors’ relationship when he shared a post to Instagram in March 2021 featuring a reel of photos of them together, and writing, “It's not lost on me, how impossible the odds were and how lucky I was to have shared a dream with my sister.
