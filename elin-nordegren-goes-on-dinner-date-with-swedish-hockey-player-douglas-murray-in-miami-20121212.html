The athlete told Swedish tabloid Expressen, “We are not dating and we have never dated.”</p><p>Indeed, Nordegren seems to be enjoying the single life. After settling her <a href=#>divorce from Woods</a> in 2010 for $100 million, she purchased a North Palm Beach estate for $12.2 million — only to have it demolished to build her <a href=#>dream multi-million-dollar mansion</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>The 21,000-square-foot mansion on the Florida beachfront property is still under construction, but will feature an Olympic pool, koi ponds, and a spa. Nordgren, who shares two children, daughter Sam, 5, and son Charlie, 3, with her golf pro ex, is proudly waving a Swedish flag on the property of her new home.</p><p>Woods, 36, also seems to be enjoying life post-divorce. The golfer was seen partying the night away with some attractive female partygoers at California’s Westlake Village Inn on Dec. 1.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Tiger was dressed in jeans and a beige sweater as he danced the night away,” an eyewitness told Us Weekly. “At one point he was surrounded by a group of six women on the club’s dance floor!”</p><p>And the witness told Us, “Tiger was the man of the hour.
