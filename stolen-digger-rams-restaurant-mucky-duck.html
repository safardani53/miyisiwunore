A gaping hole was left around the door of Grade II listed the Mucky Duck in Drakeholes, Nottinghamshire, after it was targeted on Wednesday.
The attack unfolded at around 11.50pm, when a manitou farm telehandler vehicle was spotted on CCTV driving at speed through its garden and ploughing into the wall.
The shocking video showed how the vehicle repeatedly hit the late 18th-century inn's brickwork and windows while crushing tables and chairs under its massive wheels."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
