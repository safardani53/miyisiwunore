Despite where Khloe stood with Tristian, there was no time to rethink. Baby No. 2 was en route and they were having another child together.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @khloekardashian</a><p>Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson</p></figure><p>The premiere episode ended with <a href=#>Khloe and Tristan welcoming their newest bundle of joy together</a>. Luckily, Khloe's sister <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> and her handy iPhone were able to capture some of Khloe and Tristan's first moments with their son in the delivery room.</p><p>However, given that Khloe was not pregnant, many fans wondered why she was seen was lying in a hospital bed in the episode.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’m aware there are more important things going on in the world but i need to know why Khloe Kardashian is lying in a hospital bed with her new baby when she had a surrogate.</p>— Darth_Jader (@jade08kinsella) <a href=#>September 22, 2022</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Okay but why are news outlets running pictures of khloe kardashian laid up in a hospital bed with her new baby like she birthed him and didn't pay off a surrogate to do all the work for her 😂</p>— ✨Saranne Devlin✨ (@itsbabygodzilla) <a href=#>September 22, 2022</a></figure><p>Below, a TikTok explains why the Good American CEO was filmed in a hospital bed after her surrogate delivered, and the reason is actually so heartwarming.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">TikToker explains why Khloe Kardashian was in a hospital bed when her son was born.</h2><p>"There are a lot of people questioning why Khloe Kardashian is laying in a hospital bed holding her son. And let me just repeat that, her son," emphasized TikTok user Colt Paulsen (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@gaymanwithaspraytan)</a> in a new video.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@gaymanwithaspraytan href=#>@gaymanwithaspraytan</a><p>Replying to @whatwhatwhat33 <a title=greenscreen href=#>#greenscreen</a> <a title=thekardashians href=#>#thekardashians</a> <a title=kardashians href=#>#kardashians</a> <a title=khloekardashian href=#>#khloekardashian</a> <a title=tristanthompson href=#>#tristanthompson</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Gay Man with a Spray Tan" href=#>♬ original sound - Gay Man with a Spray Tan</a></figure><p>As he reiterates, the baby was delivered via surrogate and Khloe was, in fact, not pregnant. But, as he explains, "When it comes to giving birth via surrogate, most people do skin-to-skin contact." He motions to a picture of Khloe holding her son close to her chest. "I think that's what Khloe is doing right here," he adds.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Grown ass women trying to clown Khloe Kardashian for doing skin to skin with her newborn baby is beyond ignorant</p>— 🚬 (@theyhatekaatt) <a href=#>September 22, 2022</a></figure><p>He continues to note that this is very routine. "As soon as the baby is born, it is not handed to the woman who gave birth to it. It is handed to the mother or father for skin-to-skin contact to bond with their parent," he says, explaining that, as a gay man, he hopes to one day go through this process himself.</p><p>Colt then refers to a picture of Tristan (who yes, is wearing a sweatshirt that reads "Dad") and says "As much as we may not like him, because he's trash, this is supposed to be a special and happy moment for Khloe and her family and some of these haters can not bear to see the Kardashians happy." (In other words, stop trying to find ways to tear Khloe and Tristan down during this beautiful moment.)</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>the family has grown congratulations on your new baby khloé he is the most beautiful thing in the world <a href=#>@khloekardashian</a> <a href=#>#TheKardashians</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZpoMU53zgS</a></p>— Marcos (@khloeimperio) <a href=#>September 22, 2022</a></figure><p>"The only thing I care about is how happy Khloe Kardashian is and how excited I am that she finally has a baby boy," he says as he ends his video.
