But on last night’s Watch What Happens Live special, the Real Housewives of Orange County star had to hear that David — her spouse of more than 20 years and father of her three daughters — was in love with his mistress.</p><p>“I thought I was in love with her, yes,” David told host <strong>Andy Cohen</strong> in the no-holds-barred special, before dropping another bomb.</p><p>“<strong>Heather [Dubrow]</strong> knew about it and she didn’t say anything,” David revealed of Shannon’s costar and pal. “It’s the ultimate girl code,” Shannon said of Heather’s discretion, adding that she didn’t even tell her husband, plastic surgeon and Botched star <strong>Terry</strong>. “She kept it to herself. And I am very appreciative of that. When you have information like that, especially in our small town, you can really hurt people.” David said that he “suspected” Heather knew about his eight-month long affair because “they had mutual friends.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RHOCs-Shannon-Beadors-Husband-David-Was-in-Love-With-His-Mistress-Plus-Find-Out-Which-Castmate-Knew-About-the-Affair.jpg><p>As for the other woman, Shannon admitted that she did eventually speak with her – and it didn’t go well.</p><p>“I have never once picked up the phone and called her, ever. I’ve seen her twice and keep walking. [But] I have actually spoken to her because she called me once,” the mom of three revealed. “I called her husband because I had a book on how divorce affects kids, and I wanted to get it to him and she saw that I called her husband and called me back. And in the conversation, I wanted to say certain things, but I didn’t. I said, ‘I want my family back’. Her response was, ‘He’s obsessed with me. He wants to marry me and I don’t even know the guy.’ It wasn’t a kind conversation and I kept my composure. And I said, ‘Please, you’re a strong woman. You’re a smart woman. My kids need their dad back and I need my husband back’. And at that point she said, ‘Okay, I’ll do it.’”</p><p>A week later, Shannon explained, David, finally returned home.</p><p>“Sometimes, I’ll be honest with you, there are times when I say to him, ‘I wish you didn’t come back after those two weeks. I wish you would have moved in together and I wish you would have tried to play the little nice house because let me tell you, you would have come banging my door down within six months, saying ‘what was I thinking!’ And I know that for a fact.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RHOCs-Shannon-Beadors-Husband-David-Was-in-Love-With-His-Mistress-Plus-Find-Out-Which-Castmate-Knew-About-the-Affair-2.jpg><p>During an exclusive sit-down with <strong>Us Weekly</strong> prior to the premiere of Season 10 back in June, Shannon and David explained they wanted to air their marital problems to help others going through the same issues.</p><p>“What’s important to both of us, as corny as it might sound, is we want to give other couples hope that even if there is infidelity, or something devastating in a relationship, if you both work and make the effort and love each other, you can get out,” Shannon told <strong>Us</strong>. “You can get through it and get through in a better position than you started out in.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaroJ%2BYwG6wwK%2BgnWWSmq6lu9FmrpqrXZ67brjOr5xmr5mptW60yKxkpqGjqb%2Bmv9Jmn56ZpJ2ys3nDrpmrp6diuK%2Bx1mZpaWlla35xew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeff-fortenberry.html><span>←</span><span>Jeff Fortenberry</span></a>
