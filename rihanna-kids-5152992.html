At the start of the show, Riri rocked a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>red ensemble</a> and rubbed her baby bump to announce to the world that her family was grown again! Soon after the impressive performance, one of Riri’s reps confirmed to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter</a>&nbsp;that she was, indeed, expecting.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Just six months after she announced that she was pregnant once more, Rihanna gave birth to her second son on August 3, 2023. Although Rihanna has not revealed an official statement on the birth at this time, sources close to her told TMZ that her son’s name starts with an “R” just like baby RZA! Leading up to her second son’s arrival, Rihanna showed off her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bare baby bump</a> while vacationing in Barbados on July 1.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Two months later, Rihanna shared the name of her second child — Riot Rose Mayers — and first-<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>look photos of their son</a>.</p><h2>What Rihanna Has Said About Motherhood</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Rihanna gushes about her pregnancy with baby number two and gives an update on 'R9.' <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#MetGala</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/sroat528aL</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-17>— Entertainment Tonight (@etnow) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>May 2, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-19>It’s no secret that the Savage X Fenty founder loves being a mom, as she has done multiple interviews over the last year about her pregnancies and how she felt about being a first-time mom. While at the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Met Gala in May 2023</a>, she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a> that her second pregnancy was different than her first. “It’s so different from the first one,” she gushed at the time. “Just everything! No cravings, tons of nausea, everything’s different.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>Rihanna also expressed that her second pregnancy left her full of energy. “I’m enjoying it! I feel good… I feel energetic,” she shared. “I’m in love! I’m obsessed and I don’t even feel guilty about it.” Months prior, in February 2023, she also dished to Vogue UK&nbsp;about <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>postpartum life</a>. “It’s everything. You really don’t remember life before, that’s the craziest thing ever,” Rihanna told the fashion mag. “There are photos of my life before – but the feeling, the desires, the things that you enjoy, everything, you just don’t identify with it because you don’t even allow yourself mentally to get that far.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>She also opened up about what the first few days were like when they brought home RZA. “Essentially, from one person I became two. You walk into the hospital&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>as a couple</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>leave as a family of three</a>. It’s nuts. And oh, my gosh, those first days are insane,” she added. “You don’t sleep. At all. Not even if you wanted to. We came home, cold turkey, had no one. It was just us as parents and our baby. Man, you’re a zombie for the most part.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9Gin5qmnpZ6rLXDrGRuaWVnhnp%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lil-tay-you-guys-i-am-not-dead.html><span>←</span><span>You Guys, I Am NOT Dead!</span></a>
