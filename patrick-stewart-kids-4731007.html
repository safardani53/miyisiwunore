The 55-year-old stage actor has even appeared alongside dad in the 1993 TV film&nbsp;<i>Death Train </i>and the sitcom <i>Blunt Talk. </i>Most notably, he played <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jean-Luc Picard</a>‘s son “young Batai” in a 1992 episode of <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation.&nbsp;</i>Daniel also sports credits on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, miniseries Summer of Rockets, and most recently, Silent Witness. As a stage actor, he’s done a lot of Shakespeare, as well — but according to a 2009 interview in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Independent</a>, his father was “horrified” that he wanted to follow in his father’s footsteps.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Daniel’s parents were together for an impressive 24 years, up until 1990 — Patrick has since <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>remarried </a>twice.&nbsp;Still, Patrick expressed regret at not having been available to his children often enough. “When I got married and I had children, I missed huge amounts of time,” he told the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>New York Daily News</a> in 2015. “I would see my kids on Sundays if I was lucky.

Sophie’s middle name is Alexandra, and she was born in 1972.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Doctor Strange 2</a> actor expressed similar regrets about his time with both children, telling The Independent that he was “obsessed” with his career when Sophie was young. “I could’ve done better as a parent, when my kids were little,” he said in the 2009 article. “I was just obsessed with my work and everything else took second place. I’m trying to correct that now wherever possible with my grandchildren. And my own children seem to have forgiven me.” Patrick has four grandchildren according to The Independent, to which Sophie is reportedly the mother.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8%2Baq6uhk6B6tMDEsJirrF2gtqW%2FjG1ubGlgZYRw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amazing-race.html><span>←</span><span>Stream live TV, Movies, Originals, News, and more</span></a>
