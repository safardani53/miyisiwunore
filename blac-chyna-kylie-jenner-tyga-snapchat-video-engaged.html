She wanted Tyga to be straddling her and not Kylie. Those were supposed to be her feet in his face and not Kylie’s. Watching that video made Blac think about all the fun times she and Tyga use to have and how they use to play and fondle one another in bed.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>[jwplatform i06Onn4I]</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Our hearts go out to her. Regardless of whose&nbsp;side you’re on, everyone can empathize with how much it sucks to see your ex with someone else. If Kylie and Tyga really are engaged, “that would end Blac,” our source continued.&nbsp;She may lash out at the two, but it’s only because she wants to get back together with Tyga.&nbsp;“She doesn’t want Tyga with anyone but her,”&nbsp;our&nbsp;source continued. “All she ever wanted was to get him back, be a family again and have another child. Blac can’t believe she’s losing Tyga.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Sorry Blac, but by the looks of it, Kylie&nbsp;won’t be going anywhere soon. &nbsp;The “Scandal” rapper appears to be&nbsp;more in love with the Snapchat queen&nbsp;than ever, and in his mind, the two are already husband and wife! Even&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kanye West</a>, 38, approves of them getting married, &nbsp;which is basically all of the confirmation anyone in the Kardashian family needs. We say, let him go and find a new man of your own!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what do you think about Blac being so upset over Kylie and Tyga’s Snapchat video? Is it time that she finally moves on?
