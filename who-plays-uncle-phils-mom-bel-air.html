When two people join together in matrimony, they don’t only marry each other, but each other’s mama, their mama’s mama, and all of the drama that comes with them. We see this theory in action in Season 2, Episode 6 of Peacock’s Bel-Air, where Aunt Viv (Cassandra Freeman) gets acquainted with her in-laws."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

And if the actress looks familiar, it’s because she is!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Peacock</span><p>Anna Maria Horsford, Cassandra Freeman</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, who plays Uncle Phil’s mom on 'Bel-Air'? Meet actress Anna Maria Horsford.</h2><p>Anna made her debut in Bel-Air this March, but she’s no stranger to the small screen.</p><p>Her decades-long career in the entertainment industry started in 1977 when she snagged a role as an extra on The Doctors. Later, she appeared in <a href=#>Guiding Light</a> and starred alongside Sherman Hemsley (The Jeffersons) as Thelma Frye on the sitcom, Amen.</p><p>In the early '90s, Anna made a guest appearance in an episode of the <a href=#>original Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a> as toilet paper CEO Karen Caruthers. Later, in 1995, she booked one of her most notable roles to date with <a href=#>Ice Cube</a> and <a href=#>Chris Tucker</a> in the cult classic film <a href=#>Friday</a>. She’s also played the quintessential Black mama in How High and The Nutty Professor II: The Clumps.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Anna Maria Horsford (@annamariahorsford)</a></p></figure><p>Additionally, Anna starred in dozens of episodes of <a href=#>The Bold and the Beautiful</a> and The Wayans Bros. Most recently, she was cast in <a href=#>The Last O.G</a>., which ended in 2021, and <a href=#>Kevin Hart</a>’s 2022 Netflix film, Me Time.</p><p>Anna’s Nita Banks isn’t the only well-known star that made an appearance at the Banks family cookout. Uncle Phil’s brother, Julias Banks, also showed up in Bel-Air.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Uncle Phil’s brother is played by Bill Bellamy.</h2><p>Sibling rivalry takes on a new meaning when it comes to Uncle Phil and Julius (played by comedian Bill Bellamy).</p><p>Much like Anna, Bill’s filmography is booming. Best known for his film, How to be a Player, Bill got his break in the '90s. After being dubbed the host of MTV’s Beach House in 1993, he appeared in Love Jones with <a href=#>Nia Long</a> and <a href=#>Larenz Tate</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@billbellamy</a><p>Jabari Banks, Bill Bellamy</p></figure><p>Along with his career in standup comedy, hosting, and film, Bill also voiced Cousin Skeeter from 1998 until the Nickelodeon series was canceled in 2001.</p><p>New episodes of Bel-Air drop Thursdays on Peacock!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwec%2BlmLKrXaq7pLjEZqehoZyoeq67zGaZnqRdlraz</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./soldier-poet-king-quiz-tiktok.html><span>←</span><span>How to Take the &amp;quot;Soldier, Poet, or King&amp;quot; Quiz That's Going Viral</span></a>
