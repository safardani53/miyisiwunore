He was no doubt annoyed when both Da’vonne and Nicole were picked to play in the veto.&nbsp;</p><p>It was the OTEV. Remember the competition that solidified Frank’s fate the last time he was in the house? Yeah, it seems like it’s going to do just that again.&nbsp;</p><p>After several heats of the competition, Michelle emerged as the winner. She fell and hurt her head quite a bit, so it was a little surprising she managed to continue.&nbsp;</p><p>Michelle was ecstatic at having some power, but she knew she was going to be Frank’s number one friend for the rest of the week.&nbsp;</p><p>He immediately got her to go in a room with him and he started strategizing, but Michelle was pretty clear that the house didn’t want her to use it.&nbsp;</p><p>Frank implied they did and wanted Da’vonne to be the one going out of the game on Thursday, so Michelle asked him to prove it.&nbsp;</p><p>She went to sit with her alliance members and told them everything. James said they should call a house meeting to discuss what should happen.&nbsp;</p><p>Frank was quick to quip that they should get rid of Da’vonne. She fired back that it wasn’t going to happen.</p><p>Paulie then emerged from the bathroom and said that he was going to pull Frank aside and tell him his game was over.&nbsp;</p><p>Frank respected that and the conversation was over.&nbsp;</p><p>Michelle then went to get ready and Bridgette followed. Michelle doesn’t have the time of day for Bridgette.&nbsp;</p><p>She feels like she stole Frank from her and has done a lot of sketchy things in the house.&nbsp;</p><p>She was brutally honest with Bridgette, who tried to make amends with her. Michelle made it clear that there was a time when Frank was her number one, but Bridgette’s scheming put an end to that.&nbsp;</p><p>At the veto meeting, Michelle decided not to use the veto. This means that either Frank or Bridgette will be evicted.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you think of the latest drama?</p><p>Was Michelle too rude to Bridgette?</p><p>Hit the comments below!</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>14 Most Toxic Relationships in Reality TV History</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2puX2WEcK7IoGSbqp%2Bptaa%2BjKucnJmgYra0ecyimqGdnKGybq2Mm6ylpKlk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-morgan-fairchild-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Morgan Fairchild Dating Now</span></a>
