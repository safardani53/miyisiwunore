I kept praying with Kris as they struggled, moving from one rental home to another in order to survive.”</p><p>When Kathie Lee was asked to do a reality series, she told her agent to reach out to Kris, as a show with the Jenner family would be “unbelievable.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000607167672.jpg><p>She continued to pen: “It was true. Life in the Jenner home was a perpetual funny, crazy roller coaster of a ride. A circus. In one door, the Giffords, and out another door, the Jackson family. Wayne Gretzky, Scott Hamilton, O.J. Simpson - you name them. They were all a part of the Jenner’s everyday lives.”</p><p>Her agent said no “very strongly,” as she said she “wouldn’t touch them with a ten-foot pole.”</p><p>The agent did, however, refer them to Ryan Seacrest, who she represented at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>Kathie Lee wrote: “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Keeping Up with the Kardashians</a> premiered in October 2007 and began a worldwide, frenzied phenomenon that continues to this day. I remember when the first episode premiered.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/MM-KUWTK1.jpg><p>“I was nervous because I knew all too well how producers will manipulate anything they can to heighten the tension, increase the drama, and ensure they get a hit.”</p><p>The former Live with Regis and Kathie Lee host warned Kris and urged her to have creative control.&nbsp;</p><p>She wrote: “Make sure they represent you accurately. Make sure they show you saying grace over the food and going to church. It’s important.”</p><p>Kris assured her she is one of the executive producers of the E! series.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/289f4837-b69d-49e7-895a-4dee35a6bc72.jpg><p>When the premiere aired, Kathie Lee watched it with her daughter Cassidy, who was 14 at the time, and a friend.&nbsp;</p><p>She said the episode left them “speechless.”</p><p>Her daughter, who is now 27, told her: “‘But mom,’ she answered, confused, ‘they’re not like that.’”</p><p>Kathie Lee said she “hesitated” to call her friend, as she was “not sure how to say what I know I need to say.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000623438141.jpg><p>She continued to write: “This was a family I dearly loved. This was a friend I prayed with about everything. Now her family was on the verge of the kind of fame that was truly going to change everything. I was happy for her and terrified for her at the same time.”</p><p>Kathie Lee and Frank are Godparents to Kris and Caitlyn's daughters Kendall and Kylie.&nbsp;</p><p>The actress explained how Kendall, 25, and Kylie, 23, still have gifts from her, including a dollhouse and bracelet, which Kylie saved for her daughter Stormi, 2, with ex-boyfriend Travis Scott.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000607167944.jpg><p>Kathie Lee then wrote: “I have been criticized for years for my continued association with this family, but I couldn’t care less what people think.”</p><p>She also mentioned Caitlyn transitioning.</p><p>She said before the 2015 Diane Sawyer interview, Caitlyn asked if she “hated” her because of her strong faith, Kathie Lee responded: “God created you.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000538110336.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Kris has been open about her past financial hardship, in an interview with Fox News Channel’s&nbsp;<a href=#>OBJECTified</a>, she revealed she was left broke after her divorce from Robert, who passed away from cancer in 2003.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>She said: “I didn’t have anything.
