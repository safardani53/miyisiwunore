That's just not where my focus is," the reality star shared.</p><p>"I just feel like I've done it consistently for 11 years and I keep saying when asked I just feel like it's time for me."</p><p>She added: "It was just time for me to go and I feel like I've given two marriages, I've given two divorces.</p><p>"I've just <a href=#>given a lot on the show</a>, and I wouldn't do it any other way.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Cynthia ">Read More on Cynthia</h2><p>"However, I just feel like now I wanna use the amazing platform that I've had to just really do other things that I wanna do.</p><p>"I'm like one of the older housewives- I want to just have fun and just live my life in a different way right now with a little less drama, to be honest."</p><p>The TV personality is referring to her exes <a href=#>Mike Hill</a> and <a href=#>Peter Thomas</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Her divorce from Mike</a> was finalized in December 2022 after two years of marriage and, before that, her divorce from Peter was finalized in March 2017 after&nbsp;seven years&nbsp;of marriage.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2>HOUSEWIVES CAMEO</h2><p>That's not to say that she's not open to making cameos on The <a href=#>Real Housewives</a>.</p><p>She was seen filming with the cast of <a href=#>Beverly Hills</a> in March - she's especially close to <a href=#>Sutton Stracke</a> - since she moved to Los Angeles to live with her ex Mike Hill prior to their divorce.</p><p>She has since moved back to her lake house, Lake Bailey, in Atlanta.</p><p>Cynthia has also filmed some scenes for the current season of <a href=#>RHOA</a>, but isn't sure whether they will air in the <a href=#>upcoming episodes</a>.</p><p>She teased: "I do pop in and out of Atlanta a little bit this season. I did not see myself in the mid-season trailer... but I did film with the ladies a few times, so hopefully I'll be coming up.</p><p>"Right now, I'm having a blast just hanging out with these ladies in real life and I'm having fun popping in here and there."</p><h2>NENE RETURNING?</h2><p>While Cynthia isn't 100 percent down to return full-time, her former castmate, <a href=#>NeNe Leakes</a> recently told <a aria-label="TMZ (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> that she "would come back."</p><p>"I would come back for the fans because the fans are the ones that love me, love to see me in that position. I would do anything for them," she told the media outlet on July 5.</p><p>Cynthia shared her opinion on NeNe returning to RHOA.</p><p>"Look, NeNe was a great housewife. Like, nobody can ever take that from her and if they could work it out between her and the network, then God bless.</p><p>"I mean, you know, she's definitely great TV, 100 percent."</p><p>When asked about their friendship, the women's health advocate admitted her and NeNe are "cool."</p><p>Cynthia explained: "We're just not, you know, I don't wanna say we're not friends- we are in a respectful place if I see her.</p><p>"We always laugh and talk, but we're not friends like we were years ago when we were together on the show.</p><p>"But I wish her the best. I have nothing against her and it's all love for me to her."</p><p>Bravo fans are also calling for <a href=#>Porsha Williams</a>' return, especially after <a href=# aria-label="ratings continue to sink (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">ratings continue to sink</a>.</p><p>"Porsha, I definitely, 100 percent, think should go back. I know her fans wanna see her new life as Mrs. Guobadia.</p><p>"I was just at her house- she's living an amazing life and... she seems very happy and we'd love to see it," Cynthia insisted.</p><h2>NEXT CHAPTER</h2><p>The Atlanta native appeared on season one of <a href=#>Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip</a> in November 2021.</p><p>"As much as I love the show and the platform, it does come with a certain amount of stress and drama to film a reality show like that.</p><p>"And, you know, my health is a big priority for me. I'm on a health and wellness journey and actually doing a retreat this year," Cynthia told The U.S. Sun while promoting her partnership with Seagram's Escapes.</p><p>She also is making her acting career a priority, noting she has a few movies coming up that she'll be doing press for.</p><p>One she's really excited about is a movie she filmed with her 23-year-old daughter, <a href=#>Noelle Robinson</a>, called Different With Me.</p><p>The actress dished: "This is our first time in a movie together. We don't have scenes together, but she's in it and I'm it, so I cannot wait to see how she did.</p><p>"She's focusing more on acting as well. You know, her dad [Leon Robinson] is an actor, so we've all become thespians over here now."</p><p>She <a href=#>recently spoke out</a> on castmate <a href=#>Kyle Richards' separation from Mauricio Umansky</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>In between acting and focusing on her health, the Terror Lake Drive star is making time this summer to hang out with friends and share her&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peach Bellini Ombre Punch recipe</a>.</p><p>The summer cocktail is made with Seagram's Escapes Peach Bellini, bourbon, fresh lemon juice and grenadine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/mike-hill-cynthia-bailey-photo-767275264.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/porsha-williams-kandi-burruss-tucker-680452446.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/cynthia-bailey-supplied-diana-cooper-831070443-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZWyBeX2XaKmhp5FisLq606GgmmWSlratsdhmqZ6roKS7pb%2BMrKeem6WhrrW1zqdkq52kqr%2Bvtc2gZKygn6x6pbXVqKmcnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./manu-raju.html><span>←</span><span>Manu Raju</span></a>
