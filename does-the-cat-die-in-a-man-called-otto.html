When a lively young family moves in next door, he meets his match in quick-witted and very pregnant Marisol, leading to an unexpected friendship that will turn his world upside-down."</p><p>A Man Called Otto is an adaptation of the Swedish book A Man Called Ove, which was published in 2012 by the author Fredrik Backman. In 2015, a cinematic adaptation of the same name was released.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While Backman's story may feel grounded and all too real for some, A Man Called Ove is a fictional story. However, there is a real-life Ove who inspired Backman to write the book, even if the events of the story are fake.</p><p>A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a> interview with Backman in 2016 allowed the author to open up his own personal "Ove." While working as a freelancer for a Swedish publication, one of Backman's peers witnessed a man by the name of Ove have a meltdown while purchasing tickets to an art museum until his wife was able to de-escalate the situation at hand. "Ove" became a character in Backman's blog, which eventually turned into a novel. Since, it's been adapted for the screen a few times over, most recently in 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4ytn55lk5bBbrDInmSipl2Weq6tzWaamqScmrFuu9Otpg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./claire-danes-young-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Claire Danes Young: Photos Hollywood Life</span></a>
