Although he was officially dating film star Adele Jergens at the time, Berle claimed to have had a brief affair with the young actress.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Berle, the first superstar of the TV era (and, according to Truman Capote and showbiz lore, famously well-endowed), also starred with Monroe as himself in the aptly-titled film Let's Make Love in 1960.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Marilyn was on the climb in Hollywood, but there was nothing cheap about her," he wrote in <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener nofollow">his autobiography</a>. "She wasn't one of the starlets around town that you put one meal into and threw into the sack. Maybe she didn't know exactly who she was, but she knew she was worth something.

The duo would become nearly inseparable on and off set over the next seven years, sparking rumors of a relationship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress' dependence on Lytess grew so intense that she began refusing to film scenes without her coach nearby. The speculation continued when Monroe moved into Lytess' home to prepare for her role in 1952's Don't Bother to Knock.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the nature of their relationship remained a mystery, Lytess was openly hostile to Monroe's male suitors, especially <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>Joe DiMaggio</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She was a great teacher, but she got really jealous about the men I saw.

"A man who had kissed me once had said it was very possible that I was a lesbian because apparently I had no response to males — meaning him," she wrote. "I didn't contradict him because I didn't know what I was ... Now, having fallen in love, I knew what I was.

"I expected a flashy New York sports type, and instead, I met this reserved guy who didn't make a pass at me right away," she wrote. "He treated me like something special."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They married on Jan. 14, 1954, in a quiet ceremony at City Hall in his native San Francisco.

She began cooking, cleaning and taking care of Miller's children, who all loved spending time with her. But when Monroe went back to work on The Misfits, written by Miller, their relationship began to crumble.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Monroe's drug addiction caused problems on set and at home, and shortly before the film's premiere in 1961, she and Miller divorced after five years of marriage.
