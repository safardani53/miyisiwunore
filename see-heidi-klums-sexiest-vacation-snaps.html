Very, very much on time and very organized,” the catwalk star said.</p><p>Last November,&nbsp;<a href=#>Heidi</a>, then 49, admitted&nbsp;<a href=#>she would like to have a baby</a>&nbsp;with her rock star husband.</p><p>Speaking exclusively to The U.S. Sun at the pre-filming finale of&nbsp;<a href=#>America's Got Talent All-Stars</a>&nbsp;show she confessed she often&nbsp;<a href=#>thinks about starting a family</a>&nbsp;with Tom.</p><p>"I mean wanting it and it actually being possible are always two different things," Heidi said.</p><p>"The big 50 is just around the corner. And things get harder when you get older. But would I want it? Sometimes I think yes."</p><p>She is already mom to&nbsp;<a href=#>daughter Leni, 18, and sons Henry, 16, Johan, 15, and Lou, 13</a>.</p><h2>HOT AND HEAVY</h2><p>Heidi again flaunted her incredible figure, this time in a thong bikini, while she <a href=#>enjoyed a steamy makeout session</a> with&nbsp;Tom at Porto Cervo in Sardinia, Italy.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>AGT</a>&nbsp;judge got frisky and grabbed the butt of her rockstar husband during their romantic walk on the beach.</p><p>While wearing bright pink trunks, Tom buried his head into her neck and shoulders.</p><p>With his arms wrapped around the model's waist, she sank her hand and grabbed a chunk of his booty.</p><p>The&nbsp;model teased her bikini body as she strolled into the calm waves.</p><p>While wading in the water, the TV personality wrapped her arms around her hubby as she planted her lips against his.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

captured the TV host nearly bursting out of her cherry-printed bikini.</p><p>Heidi let her sunkissed hair fall along her shoulders in Farrah Fawcett-style in the flavorful snap.</p><p>She donned an elaborate necklace that ran down her chest and ensconced her breasts.</p><p>The&nbsp;model took a lick of an ice cream cone while also wearing reflective aviator sunglasses.</p><p>Her scant cherry-patterned bikini left little to the imagination and she finished off the look with bright red nails that matched the swimsuit.</p><p>Around the same time, the talent show judge <a href=#>nearly spilled out of her triangle bikini</a> while her husband got frisky and grabbed his wife's booty at the beach.</p><p>In the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Instagram</a>&nbsp;reel, the pair skinny-dipped into the crystal-clear water.</p><p>Heidi flaunted her bikini body as she teased cleavage and her long, bare arms.</p><p>She appeared to be wearing a steamy pinkish bikini top.</p><p>Tom kept his hand on his wife's butt as the couple covered their eyes with glasses and kept their caps on their heads.</p><p>The&nbsp;reality show host captioned the post: "Summer lovin'" along with red heart and kissy emojis.&nbsp;</p><h2>FIT FIGURE</h2><p>While enjoying her&nbsp;<a href=#>two-week hiatus</a> from America's Got Talent, <a href=#>Heidi got up close and personal </a>for a selfie that showed off her cleavage in a pink and white crochet top bikini.</p><p>The actress flaunted her tanned skin while wearing the swimsuit, a baseball cap, and yellow-tinted aviator sunglasses.</p><p>Her light blonde hair blew across her face as she stared into the camera and soaked in the Italian sun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

new video clip</a>&nbsp;that showed her from the back as she leaned over a wire fence and looked at the scenic mountains in front of her.</p><p>Heidi slowly moved her butt back and forth while wearing a multicolored striped bikini that featured ties on both sides of its bottoms.</p><p>The bathing suit was red, pink, blue, and white, and also included a white trim around both the top and bottom pieces.</p><p>The star's blonde looks appeared damp and tousled from underneath her black trucker hat.</p><p>She also opted for a pair of oversized glasses as the shoeless beauty took in the beautiful Italian sights.</p><p>The very end of the clip showed Heidi turning around and walking toward the camera, where she showed off her toned midsection and long, lean legs.</p><p>Heidi again <a href=#>flaunted her fit figure while packing on the PDA</a> with Tom.</p><p>Heidi&nbsp;and Tom were spotted on a beach in Sardinia where the supermodel showed off her physique in a leopard-print bikini and wrap.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

bracelets.</p><p>Heidi looked decades younger while flaunting her body.</p><p>Tom wore a white bathing suit and shirt and kept the sun out of his face by wearing a brown fedora on his head.</p><p>The coupled sunbathed on the beach before Tom took a dip in the ocean.</p><p>Heidi shocked her fans when she went <a href=#>completely nude&nbsp;</a>in risque photos from her hotel room.</p><p>She took to&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;with her steamiest set of vacation snaps.</p><p>Heidi posted a carousel of photos that first showed the supermodel peering out the window of her luxurious hotel room.</p><p>The photo showed Heidi from the side as she appeared to have no clothes on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/heidi-klum-flaunts-incredible-figure-831281535.jpg><p>The moment was captured as a white sheet seemed to hug half of Heidi's body and her tousled blond locks fell over her shoulder.</p><p>The photo also showed the unmade hotel bed, making it seem as though Heidi had just gotten out of bed to peek out the window.</p><p>The second photo in the set showed the couple's breakfast spread, which included soft-boiled eggs, a fruit bowl, and cubes of bread.</p><p>The third showed a naked Heidi once more as she posed behind a poster that listed: "Jean Paul Julien Paco & Les Autres."</p><p>Only the side of Heidi's backside, part of her upper thigh, and the top of her shoulder could be seen as she used the large poster to cover up her naked body.</p><p>Heidi would also <a href=#>take Sardinia by storm</a> with a set of steamy beach photos.</p><p>Heidi and&nbsp;Tom openly showed their love for each other during another beach excursion as they spent time in the sand once more.</p><p>The model was seen in a cheeky, white thong bikini that featured small cherries throughout, which seamlessly matched her fiery nail polish.</p><p>Heidi left her blonde hair touseled and rocked a pair of oversized sunglasses while enjoying another day in the sun next to her husband.</p><p>Heidi and Tom, who rocked neon yellow swim shorts with a Mickey Mouse pattern, were seen holding hands while getting out of the water.</p><p>From the back, Heidi's barely-there bikini bottoms showed that the German model left little to the imagination with the standout swimsuit.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The couple was also seen cuddling up on a cushioned beach chair as they took a break from their fun in the water.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
