The 43 year old apparently befriended Faughey six years ago at a guitar camp. It is unclear what caused police to interview this man. Police have wrapped up their interview with this individual and he was released. He had apparently kept up the friendship, and spoke with the doctor just days ago. Bethlehem, PA is 85 miles from the scene of the crime.</strong></p><p align=left><strong>A <a href=# title="Savage Cleaver" rel=noopener>composite sketch</a> of the assailant has been released by New York City police department. More photos below, including a photo of Dr. Faughey and her husband Walter Adam. Surveillance cameras caught the suspect entering the building with several roller bags that presumably carried the murder weapons. </strong><strong></strong></p><p align=left>Police in Manhattan’s Upper East Side have identified the 56 year old psychologist who was hacked to death with a meat cleaver as <strong>Dr.</strong> <strong>Kathryn Faughey</strong>. Her office is located on East 79th Street and she is said to reside in a home across the street.The psychologist was attacked on Tuesday night, and one of her colleagues, <strong>Dr. Kent Shinbach</strong>, 70, sustained serious injuries while trying to help her ward off the male suspect. The staff psychiatrist was taken to New York Presbyterian Hospital Weill/Cornell.</p><p>Faughey was a licensed psychologist, practicing cognitive behavioral therapy, which focuses on changing feelings and behaviors. The male suspect, apparently one of her patients, was said to be very deranged, and the murder weapons were likely a meat cleaver and knife, both found at the scene. The knife was <a href=# title="Deranged patient" rel=noopener>severely bent</a>.</p><p>Police were summoned by a building doorman at 9:00pm Tuesday night. The scene was said to be blood soaked and totally trashed. The assailant reportedly told the doorman that he was coming to see Dr. Shinbach. He chatted with another patient in the waiting room and then entered Dr. Faughey’s office. Dr. Shinbach found her there after she had been assaulted, and was then attacked by the same assailant, who reportedly had three weapons.<br></p><p>The suspect escaped from the basement of the building. He is described as middle aged with blonde hair. We will provide more details as they emerge. See related post below for more information on a suspect that was questioned by police in Bethlehem, PA today and learn about his connection to the deceased doctor.</p><p>Check out five photos of the slain physician and crime scene photos after the jump.</p><ul class=thumbnails><li class=span3></li><li class=span3></li><li class=span3></li><li class=span3></li><li class=span3></li></ul><p style=text-align:center align=left></p><p><br></p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY6boK2slaOur7DBqKynnF%2BZv263xKerZquYnrujrcKhZJyqmam2pK3LZpurZZuWwam%2B2Kdkn5mlnLWmxYykoKWklZl6sbTOraasZWJk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cheltenham-festival-2018-sam-spinner-heads-38-entries-for-the-sun-bets-stayers-hurdle.html><span>←</span><span>Cheltenham Festival 2018 - Sam Spinner heads 38 entries for the Sun Bets Stayers' Hurdle</span></a>
