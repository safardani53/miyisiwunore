This role is definitely different than any other role I’ve done in the past (friends & family you have been WARNEDDD) BUT happy/anxious/excited that it’s finally out in the world for everyone to watch! Xx.” The first two snaps showed her filming scenes in a yellow floral dress with a cream cardigan, white socks and sneakers. It was followed by a photo of her chair on set, which was positioned next to her co star’s chair: <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sex & The City</a> icon&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kristin Davis</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The film follows Mary, played by Kristin, an author experiencing writer’s block who hires a nanny named Grace, who is played by Greer, to look after her kids while she attempts to write. The psychological thriller also stars <strong>Dermot Mulroney</strong>. In Greer’s March 20 post, she also shared a mirror selfie in a bright pink one-piece, and a selfie with the cast. “Just watched it. you look sooo beautiful in every scene! And the bathing suit on you, also very exciting the whole movie. Great job,” one fan commented, while another wrote, “I saw the movie yesterday, it’s good. Your performance was very interesting and very beautiful.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/greer-grammer-swimsuit-on-set-embed1.jpg alt=greer width=620 height=875 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Prior to her turn in the Netflix movie, she was crowned Miss Teen Malibu in 2008 and 2009 respectively, before studying theater at USC.
