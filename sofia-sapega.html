Roman and Sofia’s prison video became viral.</p><p>Sofia Sapega spoke in the video. Andrew said he’s been treated with courtesy and has no problems. He’ll help the police. Protasevich’s father approached the BBC after seeing the video and expressed concern that his son may be tortured. He is unsure if his son speaks for himself or reads from a script.</p><p>Sofia’s parents shared recordings to seek public and European aid.
