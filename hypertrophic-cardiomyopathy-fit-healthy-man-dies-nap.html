conditions.</p><p>Dave said: “Jono had always seemed so fit and healthy and was no different on that day.&nbsp;</p><p>“He had spoken to his mum in the afternoon and finished by saying he was going to catch up on a couple of hours sleep.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on heart health">Read more on heart health</h2><p>“Tragically only 45 minutes later his heart, suddenly and with no warning, stopped beating.</p><p>“We are so blessed to have had such a wonderful son and brother for Bex and proud of everything he achieved in only 27 years.&nbsp;</p><p>“So, as a family we have pledged to continue his drive and enthusiasm for life by raising money to hold screening events for 14- to 35-year-olds in the local Driffield area.”</p><p>Jono died from <a href=#>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</a> (HCM), which affects around one in 500 Brits, according to the British Heart Foundation.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>It causes the muscular wall of the heart to become thickened, making it stiffer and less able to pump blood around the body.</p><p>The condition has few noticeable symptoms and many people live with it undiagnosed, without it affecting their lives.</p><p>However, it can cause <a href=#>chest pain</a>, light-headedness, fainting, <a href=#>palpitations</a> and shortness of breath.</p><p>Jono had always appeared fit and healthy, as he did on the day he tragically died.</p><p>He spoke to his mum in the afternoon and said he was going to catch up on a few hours of <a href=#>sleep</a>.</p><p>His heart stopped beating suddenly just 45 minutes later.</p><p>Every week in the UK, 12 ‘apparently’ fit and healthy people under 35 die suddenly from a previously undiagnosed heart condition.&nbsp;</p><p>In 80 per cent of cases, there will have been no signs or symptoms, which is why Cardiac Risk in the Young’s (CRY) believes screening is so vitally important.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=#>charity</a> currently tests around 25,000 young people every year aged 14-35, at no cost to the individual when they register.</p><p>CRY’s screening model involves a quick, diagnostic procedure called an electrocardiogram (ECG).&nbsp;</p><p>If a young person is found to have an abnormality, CRY will also conduct an echocardiogram (ultrasound) on the same day for no additional charge.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>CRY also funds pioneering research into the conditions that can cause young sudden cardiac death as well as providing a unique bereavement support network for all families who have been affected.</p><p>Dave and Karen have set up a Memorial Fund with CRY for Jono.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
