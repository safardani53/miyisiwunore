Yes, you can be anything, but people may have a hard time figuring out your costume if you look wildly different from what you are trying to portray. Clothing can only take you so far.&nbsp;We've seen plenty of soon to be moms mold their costumes around their round bellies in the funniest ways. From bowling balls to avocados, there always seems to be some sort of clever new pregnant costume for the season.&nbsp;</p><p>But this guy's clever use of his body takes the cake for Halloween swag.</p><p>Josh Sundquist was diagnosed with cancer at age 9 and lost his leg shortly thereafter, but he's never let that stopped from doing anything. For example, in 2006, he represented the USA in the Paralympics. Less impressive, but just as interesting, is that each year he embraces having only one leg and makes the perfect Halloween costume.&nbsp;He's got so many great ideas that we can't even pick one of our favorites.</p><p>It started in 2006 when he went as the Gingerbread Man from Shrek.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p>HALLOWEEN COUNTDOWN üëª 8 days Here's a throwback to 2010, the beginning of one-leg-themed-type costumes.

What I love about this video is that at first you think it's just a sign. Like, where's the costume here? And then I hop away and you're like ooooooh now I get it ‚Ä¢ ALSO: If you swipe right you'll also find my 2014 costume. I dressed as a foosball player in 2014 because that was the first year I was playing in an international tournament with the US Amputee Soccer Team. So it felt appropriate. Because, if you think about it, amputee soccer is basically human foosball.</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by Josh Sundquist (@joshsundquist) on Oct 25, 2017 at 10:45pm PDT</p></figure><p>Last year he went as Lumiere.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA">Posted by <a href=#>Josh Sundquist</a> on&nbsp;<a href=#>Thursday, October 27, 2016</a></figure><p>People have been eagerly awaiting his costume for 2017 and it did not disappoint.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Here‚Äôs my Halloween costume!</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by Josh Sundquist (@joshsundquist) on Oct 26, 2017 at 4:21pm PDT</p></figure><p>He's Tigger!&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA">Posted by <a href=#>Josh Sundquist</a> on&nbsp;<a href=#>Thursday, October 26, 2017</a></figure><p>We'll have to wait another year to see what's next but I, for one, am excited to find out.&nbsp;</p><p>[h/t <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bored Panda</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKyimrultc2gZmtoYWx8cnyOa25oknGHfbiUjqilnmWcmrRutMClo6ivlZq7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-and-reggie-bush-totally-might-break-up.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Kim Kardashian &amp;amp; Reggie Bush Totally Might Break Up</span></a>
