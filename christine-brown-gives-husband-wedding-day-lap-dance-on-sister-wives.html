The duo’s wedding guests stand around them cheering.</p><p>Elsewhere in the clip, Christine and David recall how they found each other.</p><p>“I stalked him. Found him online,” Christine says. David chimes in to joke that after meeting up with Christine in person, he discovered that “she’s aggressive.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Christine-Brown-Gears-Up-to-Marry-David-Woolley-on-Sister-Wives1.jpg><p>The twosome<a href=#> tied the knot</a> in October after <a href=#>debuting their romance</a> on Valentine’s Day. Five of Christine’s six children with ex-husband <strong>Kody Brown</strong> were in <a href=#>attendance</a>: son Paedon, 25, and daughters Aspyn, 28, Mykelti, 27, Ysabel, 20, and Truely, 13. According to photos obtained by Us, the exes’ daughter Gwendlyn, 22, and her wife, <strong>Beatriz Queiroz</strong>, were not present.</p><p>In addition to being cheered on by most of her children, Christine had the support of former sister wife <strong>Janelle Brown</strong>, who confirmed her split from Kody, 54, in December 2022, over one year after Christine and Kody announced their separation in November 2021.</p><p>“The fact that they are openly affectionate soothes that wound that Kody inflicted,” Janelle, 54, says of Christine and David in the trailer. Later in the teaser, Janelle can be seen getting her makeup done for the big day while Christine has her hair blow-dried.</p><p>“This is really fun,” Janelle tells Christine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Christine-Brown-Gears-Up-to-Marry-David-Woolley-on-Sister-Wives2.jpg><p>As for how Kody feels about Christine moving on, he starts to tell cameras, “I knew David and Christine were gonna get married. She made the accusation that I had —,” before his wife, <strong>Robyn Brown</strong>, cuts him off.</p><p>“Aren’t we just so happy for them?” she asks Kody pointedly before saying to the cameras, “We’re just so happy for them.”</p><p>Kody and Robyn, 45, didn’t attend Christine’s wedding, nor did<strong> Meri Brown</strong>. Robyn became Kody’s only spouse after Kody and Meri, 52, confirmed in January that they had <a href=#>ended their spiritual marriage</a>.</p><p>While not every member of the Brown family was present for Christine and David’s nuptials — which took place at the Red Cliffs Lodge in Moab, Utah — the couple couldn’t be more thrilled about the next chapter of their lives.</p><p>“I’m excited to say ‘I do,’ and he’s excited to say ‘I do’ to anything I want,” Christine quips in the trailer.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>David — who made his <a href=#>Sister Wives debut</a> during the Sunday, December 17, episode of the show — adds during a confessional: “I [feel] like I’ve known you my whole life.”</p><p>Part 1 of Sister Wives: Christine and David’s Wedding will air on TLC Sunday, January 7, at 10 p.m. ET, with part 2 airing the following week.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqhqpmowaq6xGaZq6eno3qotdWeqmagpaivorrDZq6enJSeu6h5w5qwZqSRpXqlrc2cnGannmLAqr%2FTnqlmr5mrsrR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./thank-you-to-the-dedicated-newsagents.html><span>←</span><span>Were saying thank you to the dedicated newsagents who promote our paper and help keep loyal reade</span></a>
