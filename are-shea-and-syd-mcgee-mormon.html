And everything changed,” Shea <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">blogged in 2014</a>.</p><p>“My business grew exponentially,” Shea added. “I had people from throughout Southern California, and even across the country, asking me to design their homes. I had no idea how to handle the workload, but never considered working with my husband to be an option. And then one day it clicked. Syd was searching for a new start-up to dive into and there was the perfect candidate right in front of him. I remember crying and asking, ‘Are you sure we can do this?’ As it turns out, the answer was, ‘Yes!’”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>With that new plan in mind, the couple sold their home, moved to Utah, and started Studio McGee in Salt Lake City.
