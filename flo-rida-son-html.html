They had a casual relationship, nothing serious.</p><p><img alt="Flo Rida's baby mama Alexis Adams claims the musician has never seen or acknowledged their son, Zohar Paxton." height=417 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/uploads/images/Flo-rida-son-baby-mama.jpg width=650 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Flo Rida's baby mama Alexis Adams claims the musician has never seen or acknowledged their son, Zohar Paxton.</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">BCKOnline</a>/Alexis Adams/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The relationship went on until, in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">her own words</a>, she&nbsp;"discovered [she]&nbsp;was pregnant" in 2016.</p><p>After finding this out, Flo Rida insinuated he wanted her to abort the baby. He told her he was not ready for it. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>After this, he even sent her messages, calling Zohar <a href=# rel="follow noopener">horrible things</a>. And he did not acknowledge Zohar to be his child.</p><p>Amidst this, Adams had another problem to deal with. Zohar was born with Hydrocephalus, a neurological condition that causes excess fluid build-up in the brain.</p><p>Therefore, for financial help, she started reaching out to Flo Rida. But he did not respond. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>This forced Adams to take legal action — she took him to court in early 2017 for ignoring child support. At the time, the only time Flo Rida and Zohar had been in the same room was when he had to take a paternity test.</p><p>The test result&nbsp;was&nbsp;one of the bases for her to sue him. The test suggested a 99.99 percent chance Flo Rida was Zohar's father.</p><p>In her filings, Adams requested child support, mainly because she was struggling to cover her son's medical bills.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Flo Rida came back with a response to this, saying he was already paying her five thousand dollars a month and that she was being greedy asking for more money.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The musician was yet to see or acknowledge his son&nbsp;as of October 2020. Adams put up a video with Zohar that month and revealed that he was also on the spectrum.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>And in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">podcast</a> with Shawn Allen, she also mentioned how his legal team used the term "allegedly" when describing Zohar as his son,&nbsp;when he was approached about the subject by <a href=# rel=follow>Wendy Williams</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Not Flo Rida's First Time</h2><p>As it would come out after this case, this was not the first time Flo Rida had ignored his child. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Williams revealed that before this, Flo Rida had gone through a similar situation in 2015.</p><p>In that case, too, he did not acknowledge that the child was his and reached a court settlement for child support payments later on.</p><p>As for Zohar, he is growing up well. By 2019, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">understood the world</a> through art and music and was already giving back to the Autism community. He had raised $10 thousand for Autism research that year. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ6cpHqztcOaZKynnmO1tbnL</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dizzee-rascal-was-convicted-of-assaulting-his-ex-fiancee-cassandra-jones.html><span>←</span><span>Dizzee Rascal Was Convicted Of Assaulting His Ex- Fiance Cassandra Jones</span></a>
