In the first film, her character is told by Elle Woods (<a href=#><strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong></a>) to do the <a href=#>“bend and snap” move</a> to land the delivery man that she has been swooning over for months.</p><p>Coolidge, however, isn’t convinced that bending over and quickly picking up a pen while pushing up your breasts is a fool-proof pick-up tool. She did note on Saturday that it could work with one wardrobe change.</p><p>“I’d have to say when I did do the ‘bend and snap,’ I was wearing my underwear and I feel like in real life you have to leave it off,” she added.</p><p>The <a href=#>White Lotus</a> star explained that while the “bend and snap” is memorable, it’s <a href=#>nowhere near the most quoted line</a> from the two films.</p><p>“It’s so weird because there’s something about the Fourth of July line from Legally Blonde 2. I get so many DMs and texts and people leaving things in my mailbox,” she confessed. “And if I’m out on that day, people just go nuts.”</p><p>The <a href=#>American Pie actress</a> is referring to the line where Paulette says, “You look like the Fourth of July. That makes me want a hot dog real bad.”</p><p>News broke in 2020 that <a href=#>Legally Blonde 3</a> was given the green light and Witherspoon, 46, is set to return. <a href=#><strong>Mindy Kaling</strong></a> and <strong>Dan Goor</strong> were later announced as writers for the new script and the Sweet Home Alabama star’s production company, Hello Sunshine, is on board to work on the project.</p><p>While there have since been delays in production — Kaling, 43, confirmed in November 2021 that the script was still being worked on — Coolidge is ready to reprise her role.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I did hear at one point after <a href=#>The Morning Show</a> [that] it’s going [to happen],” the A Cinderella Story actress <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> in January 2020 of the new film. “But of course, there’s rumors that you read every day in the newspaper that say, ‘Legally Blonde is opening May 20 this year,’ and you’re, like, ‘Well, ugh.’ But I don’t know. I would love to play Paulette again.”</p><p>Witherspoon, for her part, confirmed in December 2021 that fans can expect the return of Paulette as Elle’s sidekick. “It’s a lot of me and this lady [Coolidge], that’s all I have to say,” she teased to <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight </a>at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGepp6es6a%2BjJymqKSZmbSmecuenpqknK56o7jOp5ueq12Xsq%2BwjJqlnWWjo66xecisZKaho6GyorDIp55o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./niclas-fullkrug.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Niclas Fllkrug net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
