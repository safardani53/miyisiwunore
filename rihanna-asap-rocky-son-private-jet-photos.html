Rihanna, 34, also hid her face with a black baseball cap, but her signature long, black hair could be seen down the sides. She seemed like she was watching her step as she deboarded the flight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/rihanna-and-asap-rocky-with-their-newborn-son-backgrid-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Meanwhile Rocky, 33, sported a brown flannel and baggy jeans. Like his girlfriend, the “Praise The Lord” rapper rocked a Yankee cap, which kept his face hidden. It also looked like he accessorized with a gold chain necklace. While the couple’s son wasn’t pictured, he was reportedly carried by a security guard, and was probably given a ride with his parents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/rihanna-and-asap-rocky-with-their-newborn-son-backgrid-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Rocky and Rihanna <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed their first child</a> back in May, and they seem to both be loving parenthood. A couple of months after their son was born, a source close to the&nbsp;Loud&nbsp;singer revealed that she’s turned her attention from her long-awaited ninth <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>album to being a mom</a>. “Right now, her focus is on soaking up the blessing of being a new mom and bonding as a little family with Rocky. He’s been such an incredible partner, he’s busy with shows and getting his album ready but if he’s not working, he’s by her side,” they said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Even though the couple are clearly loving being parents, they’ve still found time to go on<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> romantic date nights</a> together. Most recently, the pair were seen holding hands as they stepped out for an evening together in New York City, with RiRi <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rocking a tiny black dress</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5BuZquhmJa7r62MmqqaqF2nvKS32GaqqKZdpb%2BqwsCtnGailal6sbTOraasZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pam-tommy-lily-james-fake-breasts.html><span>←</span><span>Pam &amp;amp; Tommy star Lily James wore out 50 pairs of fake breasts</span></a>
