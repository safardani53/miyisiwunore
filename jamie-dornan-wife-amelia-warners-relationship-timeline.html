Their first child, Dulcie, was born in November 2013, with daughter Elva joining the family in February 2016.</p><p><a href=#>Us Weekly confirmed in October 2018</a> that the twosome were expecting a third baby. Dornan raved over his fatherhood journey weeks prior, telling The Sunday Times, “Being a dad is the best. I feel a healthy and lovely duty to provide for my kids, and I really like it. It suits me. Making my kids happy is a good thing for my wife and me to be driven by.”</p><p>He went on to reveal that he and Warner only had <a href=#>one major argument</a> up until that point in their relationship, gushing, “There’s never a day that I don’t tell her I love her. … We get frustrated at times, usually when traveling with the kids, but we’d never let anything boil and become a thing. We know couples who are plate-throwers, but that’s just not us. I’m glad it’s not us — plates are expensive.”</p><p>Before the composer <a href=#>gave birth to daughter No. 3</a> in early 2019, the Belfast actor exclusively told Us that the thrill of welcoming a child never faded. “It’s the best aspect of our lives,” he said at the October 2018 premiere of his movie A Private War. “I’m just as excited as I was the first two times.”</p><p>Dornan filmed the war drama in Jordan, and <a href=#>he missed his little ones</a> while he was away from home. “We were working 16-hour days a lot of times,” he told Us. “You just focused on work. It made it a little more bearable.”</p><p>When it comes to <a href=#>expanding their family</a> further, Dornan and Warner didn’t have a concrete plan. “Part of me feels like [I need] to put a cork in it after this,” he said on Jimmy Kimmel Live! following the pair’s third <a href=#>pregnancy reveal</a>. “But then alternatively, I feel like we make really great kids. I may just — if my wife’s willing — do it until we can’t do it anymore.”</p><p>Like many parents, the duo had to adjust to <a href=#>being home with their little ones 24/7</a> during the coronavirus pandemic. While discussing his family life in December 2020, the Fall alum said the lockdown was “challenging” and “fun” at the same time.</p><p>“Kids are amazing, ’cause they truly live in the moment,” he explained on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. “So they’re not <a href=#>concerned about what’s happening</a> and why the world is the way it is at this age. You know, they’re just [thinking], ‘This is what we have now, let’s have fun.’ So that’s a great thing to be around.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While parenting can be full of highs and lows, Dornan’s love for Warner has never wavered. “I was smitten from the start, I really was,” he told The Independent in 2015. “I’m more in love with her today than I was at the start.”</p><p>Scroll down to relive the pair’s path to romance:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt6K5yJ5knaeio66vedainZ5lkaKyrbXAZq6aqp6av7R50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZK2hnZq5qrrEaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-oreck.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | David Oreck net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
