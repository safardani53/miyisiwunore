I was not fired,” she wrote. “I decided to take a step back from filming because it became extremely toxic.

I hope I make you all proud and if I inspire a few of you along the way -that would just be the cherry on top,” she wrote via Instagram at the time. “Remember, it’s your story. So feel free to hit em with a plot twist whenever you want. YOU are in control of your own life. The power to change and evolve is already inside your HEART, you just have to make the conscious decision to do the work and put in the effort. I promise, it’s worth it. I LOVE YOU ALL SO MUCH! We couldn’t do it without all of you, so truly THANK YOU.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>MTV did not immediately respond to Us Weekly‘s request for comment.</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqhpJ%2BaerW%2BwK6rppmeYrK5tdOsZKyhlajBonnKnrBmm5yWtq6%2FjKKrZpqVmK6usYytprGhk2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brandon-sanderson-19751219-html.html><span>←</span><span>Brandon Sanderson (Novelist) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
