We've rounded up some of the best drinking games that can help you spruce up any get-together and bring you and your loved ones even closer together.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>No matter the size of your <a href=#>Thanksgiving</a> party, it's typical for family members to debate politics, ask you about your love life, or spill the details to your friends and family about your next career move. Sometimes alcohol is a fun way to lighten the mood and take the edge off these conversations. Here are a few drinking games to help reduce the pressure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Thanksgiving drinking game — "Take a sip"</h2><p>Be careful with this Thanksgiving game — you may just find yourself passed out before dessert has been served. For this game, grab an alcoholic beverage of your choice and create a list of things that if you or your guests say or do, they must "take a sip" of their drink.&nbsp;</p><p>Though you can create your own list of sayings and actions that would be tailored to your party, we've gathered a few phrases that will ensure your group is taking many sips.</p><p><strong>"Take a sip" anytime someone:</strong></p><ul><li>Says "I'm full"</li><li>Takes a selfie</li><li>Comments on the turkey</li><li>Says the word "moist"</li><li>Asks for a family photo</li><li>Comments on your appearance</li><li>Talks about politics</li><li>Asks about a single person's dating life</li><li>Asks when "dinner will be ready"</li><li>Starts an argument</li><li>Yells because of the football games on TV</li><li>Falls asleep before dessert is served</li><li>Mentions Christmas</li><li>Starts singing Christmas tunes</li></ul><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Thanksgiving drinking game — "Word of the day"</h2><p>Another easy drinking game to play is "word of the day" (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Refinery29</a>). Those participating in this fun game will choose one obscure word. The goal is to casually fit this random word into your conversations at Thanksgiving dinner.</p><p>If you're successful and other participants overhear that the word was used, they must take a drink. However, if someone (who is not participating) comments on the word, you must drink.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">All-day Thanksgiving drinking game</h2><p>We can thank <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a> for this one. The rules of the game are simple and the game actually lasts all day. You simply take a sip every time someone passes out after the big meal, and you take another swig when a family member rudely mentions the fact that you don't have kids.</p><p>From there, keep track of when a family member makes a creepy inappropriate joke, when someone mentions Christmas, and any time someone makes fun of you for being hungover from getting drunk the night before Thanksgiving.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Cards Against Humanity' ... boozy style.</h2><p>Many people are familiar with the card game, Cards Against Humanity. The funny and off-color game is perfect for a large or small group. If you love playing this game with family and friends and want to incorporate alcohol into the fun, simply make it a rule that those who do not win a round must take a sip of their drink.</p><p>Watch out, because those not so good at this game will surely be a bit tipsy.</p><p>Have a safe and happy Thanksgiving!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWiusqsnqKumaO0brDRoqWkoZ6ceqitzJ6q</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pregnant-celebrities-baby-bumps-in-2021-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Pregnant Celebrities Baby Bumps in 2021: Photos</span></a>
