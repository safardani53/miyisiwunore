She seemed like a gold-digger and was filmed striking him. It … was not pretty.</p><p>Fans have been demanding to know if this toxic couple is together … and Anfisa is finally addressing those questions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>90 Day Fiance is a fascinating reality series in which international couples — one American, one from elsewhere — have only 90 days (per US visa laws) to spend together in the US before they must either marry, or the non-American partner must go home.</p><p>Jorge Nava is an American who liked Anfisa Arkhipchenko’s&nbsp;modeling photos and struck up a conversation with her.</p><p>He apparently convinced her that he was wealthy and that he would take care of her if she came to the US.</p><p>She arrived to find that, well, Jorge’s living financial wasn’t quite what she’d imagined. Specifically, he was in debt.</p><p>And Jorge discovered that Anfisa really, really likes to shop. She jokes that it’s the thing that she does best.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Jorge would later claim that <a href=#>Anfisa only got mean when he paid for her to get a boob job</a>. For what it’s worth, <a href=#>Anfisa&nbsp;acknowledges having gotten some work done</a>.</p><p>He also tried to imply on television that she was a sex worker.</p><p>But even when they were first trying to work things out, things didn’t go well. <a href=#>Anfisa Arkhipchenko slapped Jorge Nava on camera</a>, which is very alarming because domestic violence is always alarming.</p><p>Anfisa then tried to turn it around by <a href=#>accusing Jorge Nava of "violence"</a>&nbsp;… claiming that his alleged control over the couple’s finances was the real abuse.</p><p>(To be serious, there are cases of viciously controlling spouses who use financial control to dominate their partners; but you don’t usually see the victims in those situations going shopping quite as often as Anfisa was shown doing)</p><p>All around, these two struck viewers as a toxic couple. And their interactions horrified their 90 Day Fiance costars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But, after all of that, <a href=#>Anfisa celebrated her anniversary</a> just a month before the <a href=#>90 Day Fiance Tell-All Special</a> aired, and her name on Instagram is Anfisa Nava.</p><p>And, in the captions beside a photo of her holding a huge box of roses, Anfisa finally decided that it was time to address the questions that fans ask the most.</p><p>"I would like to address some of the most popular comments under my posts: Are you still married? Where is your husband?"</p><p>But she’s not prepared to give a direct answer:</p><p>"Right now I prefer to keep my personal life private."</p><p>If you’re thinking that a reality star asking for privacy is odd, she anticipated that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"You might say ‘but you were on a reality show!’"</p><p>She sure was.</p><p>"Yes, and you should understand that even on the show you don’t see my whole life 24/7, you only see parts of it that were chosen by producers."&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, we know that.</p><p>"Same with my Instagram, only now the ‘producer’ is me."</p><p>That’s one way of looking at it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Anfisa then poses a question to her followers, and it’s unclear if that question is rhetorical&nbsp;or intended to be answered:</p><p>"Do you think it’s better to keep your relationship and personal life private or to share your happiness with everybody?"</p><p>As you can imagine, her followers replied in the comments, sounding off with different answers.</p><p>But … are she and Jorge still together?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>We can’t imagine another reason for Anfisa to be holding a box of roses, unless it’s a product endorsement, in which case she really should have included the #ad tag in her captions, per FCC guidelines.</p><p>Despite common sense, we sort of get the feeling that Anfisa and Jorge are still together or still trying to work through things in some capacity.</p><p>In the mean time, Anfisa is modeling and it looks like she’s doing a number of endorsements on Instagram.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>It may be that they’re keeping up an air of mystique for "privacy."</p><p>Or maybe it’s just because Anfisa feels that confirming that they’re together or apart will, either way, alienate some followers, and she wants that money, honey.</p><p>Or it’s possible that the two are keeping mum because they’re going to be on 90 Day Fiance some more, and any answers would actually be spoilers.</p><p>That is what makes the most sense, to us.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>90 Day Fiance: Which Couples Are (Somehow) Still Together?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2V%2BcK3Nn6CsmV2Wv6y0yKmaoZ2eoLxurc2dZKOnopyybrrAr5hmmaKaerW0xLJkrKyZobluwM6gnK2glad8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stolen-digger-rams-restaurant-mucky-duck.html><span>←</span><span></span></a>
