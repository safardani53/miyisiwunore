He turned to LA-based celeb jeweler <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kyle Chan Design</a>, (<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>who has worked with everyone</a> from <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></a> to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ariana Grande</strong></a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ed Sheeran</strong></a> and, of course, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lisa Vanderpump</strong></a>!), to come up with the perfect sparkler for his unique lady, opting for a champagne diamond. “The ring is made up of a natural champagne color, rose-cut, pear-shaped center diamond that weighs in at approximately two carats. Due to the unique cut of this diamond, it has a three carat face. It is set in a custom-made, 14-karat rose gold setting and slightly elevated to give it that royal, elegant look, with small pave white diamonds on the setting,” Kyle told us.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>While the center stone and setting was so unique, Tom didn’t stop there — he made sure to add a very special detail to the design. “Tom was born in October and the birthstone color should be pink or opal. Instead of using a regular pink stone, we set a small pink sapphire inside of the band, as you can see in the picture.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>How sweet is that?! The designer said that Tom enlisted his BFF, (and fellow Vanderpump Rules cast member), <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tom Sandoval</strong></a>, to help him with the thoughtful design. “It was both Tom Sandoval’s and Tom Schwartz’s ideas. So when Katie wears this ring, Tom will always be with her in the form of the pink sapphire,” Kyle said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>Shari Fabrikant</strong> of <strong>Robert Fabrikant Inc.</strong>, expert jeweler in NYC, also weighed in on the ring. “It’s definitely very unique. Depending on the quality of the diamond and the design, it would cost around $25,000.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>We couldn’t be happier for the couple — and we can’t wait to watch the proposal go down on the fourth season of Vanderpump Rules!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Are you loving Katie’s unique ring?</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>Katrina Mitzeliotis</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWllZH14e49xZqSZpJ6ybrnApaannalisq%2BzwKCcpp2eqXqztc2gZK2nnWLApLTWmqmtsl2au6itxp6bZqiYpMGwedWapZ2doqXCrryMq6ylnaNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2px6oycnxzqxhuoh9uzgpsdsvnxlievd.html><span>←</span><span>Watch Beverly Hills, 90210 Season 7 Episode 3: A Mate For Life</span></a>
