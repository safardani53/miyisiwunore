She moved to San Bernardino to finish her education after receiving a scholarship from California State University for her athletic abilities.</p><p>She is extremely dedicated to her work, and her work speaks for itself.

She rose to prominence through her talent, dedication, and determination to outperform the competition. A young woman who began in Pro Mode and Nostalgia Funny Car went on to become the best dragster in the country. Leah began her winning streak in 2018 when she won the NHRA SAMTech Factory Stock Showdown Championship.</p><p>DSR’s first series championship came in their first year in their class. Leah demonstrated her brilliance by becoming the course’s first female winner in its short history. Leah won the 2010 Nostalgia Funny Car championship while competing in the NHRA Hot Red Heritage Series as a rookie. She has won 11 events in total, including eight Top Fuel races and three Pro Modified races. Her best ET in her career is 3.361 seconds, and her top speed is 334.15 miles per hour.</p><h2>Leah Pritchett Achievements and Awards</h2><p>Leah has been a role model for all young people who want to be a part of the racing world. She has progressed in her career and demonstrated enormous potential as a young racer, and it is her pure love of racing that has propelled her to such heights. Leah is now regarded as the best dragster in the country, but she remains humble to this day. She has 1 factory showdown win, and 11 event wins, including 8 Top Fuel and 3 Pro Modified wins. To this day, she continues to win more awards and championships while keeping the audience on the edge of their seats.</p><h2>Leah Pritchett’s Net Worth In 2023</h2><p>Her salary cannot be determined because racers are paid per race. As of December 2023, her net worth is estimated to be $5 million. Leah was one of the highest-paid racers at the Atlanta Dragway, earning $9,500. In 2016, she signed a contract with Don Schumacher Racing. She has since raced alongside Tony Schumacher and Antron Brown. A single-season win for Leah entitles her to an income of more than $10 million. She receives $5 million after sharing her share with the team.</p><p>Leah Pritchett has demonstrated to all young aspiring racers who aspire to be at the top that there is no substitute for hard work and dedication to the sport. She has been a part of this sport since she was a child and has grown up with it. Despite everything that has happened this year, the desire to race remains strong in her heart. Leah Pritchett keeps winning races and keeping the audience on the edge of their seats.</p><h2>Leah Pritchett Husband, Marriage</h2><p><strong>Leah Pritchett</strong> is married to Gary Pritchett, an NHRA Top Fuel Drag Racer Steve Torrence’s crew member, and clutch specialist. Even though they were rivals on the race track, the couple married in 2013 and proved to have a strong bond. Unfortunately, Leah filed for divorce in Indiana on July 31, 2019. There have been no updates on the couple’s situation since then. For a family going through such a difficult time, we are hoping that things will work out for Leah and Gary and that their bond will be stronger than expected.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGijnpmYYr2ztdOcn56spGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matty-healy.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Matty Healy net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
