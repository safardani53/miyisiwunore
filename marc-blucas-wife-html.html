To control the urge, she went to a rehabilitation center and became sober four years at one point in time. But four years of abstinence went in vain when she relapsed after drinking a Kir Royal with her girlfriends in The Four Seasons Hotel.</p><p>The pressure of taking care of her two kids gave her an excuse to consume more alcohol, and the situation worsened when she became a substance user.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>To top it all off,&nbsp;she threw a glass at her husband in a fit of rage in the&nbsp;Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, Los Angeles, in November 2003.&nbsp;The wound she inflicted on her husband took&nbsp;nine stitches to heal. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Haddon&nbsp;got <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">arrested</a> for domestic battery and was released when Slater defended her, saying it only was an accident.

She also became a certified Life Coach through her training in the International Coaching Federation.</p><p>Soon, she joined the National Guild of Hypnotists and earned a certificate as a Hypnotherapist. While helping people realign their minds, body, and spirit, she found herself back.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>On July 25, 2009, she&nbsp;married&nbsp;Marc Blucas, whom she had met in L.A., in Pennsylvania. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Blucas and Haddon Share Two Daughters</h2><p>Buffy the Vampire Slayer actor and his wife Haddon&nbsp;have&nbsp;two daughters.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>They&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">live</a> on a 15-acre farm in rural Pennsylvania with&nbsp;Haddon's two children from her marriage with Slater.
