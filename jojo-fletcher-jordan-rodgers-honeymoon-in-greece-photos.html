The pair were originally scheduled to wed in June 2020, but the coronavirus pandemic forced them to postpone their nuptials for nearly two years.</p><p>“It’s been such a long time coming that, like, getting through the ceremony and walking into the reception to party and have fun with our friends, we’re so excited,” <a href=#>Fletcher told Us Weekly about the wedding</a> in April. “We can let our hair down and just be like, ‘We did it! You guys, like, we made it here. We’re doing it.’”</p><p>The Cash Pad host and the former NFL player met during season 12 of <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a>, which aired in 2016. During the finale, the couple got engaged, but <a href=#>Rodgers later proposed a second time</a> so the twosome could experience the romantic moment without an audience.</p><p>“Our first engagement was so real, and meant so much to us both, but as we start to actually plan our wedding for next year I wanted to do it all over again, OUR WAY!” he wrote via Instagram in August 2019. “So I bought a new ring, made a plan (that almost fell apart multiple times), and got down on one knee all over again.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Now that the duo finally have their wedding behind them, they’re thinking about expanding their family. “It’s kind of been [a conversation that’s] coming up a little bit more recently,” <a href=#>Rodgers told Us in April</a>. “I think we’re at that time in our life where we’re like, ‘Oh, my gosh, we’ve got to have a kid tomorrow,’ but also … I don’t think we’ll wait a long time. But that might not be right away.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for more photos from Rodgers and Fletcher’s honeymoon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt7C2zmadpZ2kmLWmvoyjpquckaN6s7vDoJyrq12dvK%2Bx2KamqKZdnrtus9GenJydXaW1sMDOrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jessa-duggar-fifth-baby-name-new-video-birth.html><span>←</span><span>Jessa Duggar reveals fifth baby's name in sweet new video just days after giving birth</span></a>
