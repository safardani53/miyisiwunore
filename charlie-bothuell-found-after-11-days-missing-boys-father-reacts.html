Nancy was not buying it.</p><p>It’s hard to say if Bothuell was being defensive or just in a state of utter shock with his reactions, but the whole thing was definitely a little strange.</p><p>Authorities say they have no idea how the <a href=#>boy ended up in the basement</a>, whether he was there the whole time or whether he was recently put there.</p><p>A rep for the Detroit PD confirmed that police dogs previously combed the house at least four times prior to June 25 and did not turn up the boy.</p><span style=display:none>&nbsp;</span><p>He was found, with cereal and soda, behind a makeshift barricade of boxes; there was no secret basement area and Charlie was not being restrained.</p><p>Detroit Police Chief James Craig said at a press conference, "I’ve never seen anything quite like this … but the outcome – I couldn’t be happier."</p><p>Charlie is safe and out of the house, and will "get two things – medical treatment and some food … he was nervous but excited, and glad to see the police.</p><p>The boy’s father had said the last time he saw Charlie was at his home, when his son took a bathroom break from working out and never came back.</p><p>Charlie’s father had been administered a lie-detector test by the FBI, but results were inconclusive. The boy’s stepmother refused to take a polygraph.</p><p>No criminal charges have been filed or are being pursued at this point.</p><a href=#><img width=500 height=500 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg alt="The Hollywood Gossip" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>Strange But True News Hall of Fame</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2psX2WDcK%2FHmqmloZVir7DAx66cpaRdm7y2usNmmJ%2Bslad6cn2MnZiyq12itrS%2FyKeeZpqfrsBussCtn56qXaeyoq%2FTrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vanderpump-rules-season-4-episode-6-recap-love-bites-james-sucks.html><span>←</span><span>Vanderpump Rules Season 4 Episode 6 Recap: Love Bites, James Sucks</span></a>
