She waits and takes her time, 'cause little Miss Sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain."</p><p>It would make sense for Stone to discuss her <a href=#>dating</a> life with her mom, as the outlet reports that the pair share a close relationship.</p><p>It also notes that "little Miss Sunshine" could be referring to when Stone sang along to Natasha Bedingfield's song, Pocketful of Sunshine, in the <a href=#>movie</a> Easy A.</p><p>Swift later sings: "She's so New York when she's in L.A."</p><p>Entertainment Weekly notes that this line could refer to some of the time the megastars spent together. It reports that they previously were spotted hanging out in <a href=#>New York</a> on more than one occasion, although Stone was living in <a href=#>Los Angeles</a> at the time.</p><h2>How did Emma Stone and Taylor Swift meet?</h2><p>As per <a aria-label="People (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>, Stone and Swift met at the April 2008 Young <a href=#>Hollywood</a> Awards in Los Angeles, <a href=#>California</a>, which was hosted by <a aria-label="Hollywood Life (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollywood Life</a> magazine.</p><p>They were pictured together at the cocktail party whilst each sporting purple dresses, which is all too fitting for the then-unborn Speak Now album.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/actress-emma-stone-singer-taylor-830181102.jpg><p>Since then, the pair have maintained a strong friendship.</p><p>Over the years, they have attended multiple events together — such as the Vanity Fair&nbsp;<a href=#>Oscar</a> Party and the <a href=#>Met Gala</a> — and have supported each other's careers.</p><p>As the outlet reported, in September 2010, Swift attended the premiere of Stone's <a href=#>film</a>, Easy A.</p><p><a aria-label="Vanity Fair (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a> reported that in March 2023, Stone attended the opening night of Swift's <a href=#>Eras Tour</a> in Glendale, <a href=#>Arizona</a>.</p><p>The La La Land actress told the publication: "The concert was pretty amazing. I was lucky ’cause we’ve been friends for a really long time.</p><p>"I’ve known her since we were 17 and 18, so she hooked me up, which was very nice ’cause I know those tickets are impossible to get.</p><p>"She’s a wonderful friend. She blows my mind. I mean, the amount of sheer stamina to do three and a half hours and perform 44 songs and to maintain the extreme energy of the audience—I’ve never seen anything like it."</p><h2>How can I stream Taylor Swift's new song?</h2><p>You can stream When Emma Falls in Love — as well as the entirety of Speak Now (Taylor's Version) — via <a aria-label="multiple music streaming services (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple music streaming services</a>, including <a href=#>Apple</a> Music, <a href=#>Spotify</a>, <a href=#>Amazon Music</a>, <a href=#>YouTube</a> Music, Pandora, Tidal, and Deezer.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Its <a href=# aria-label="lyric video (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">lyric video</a> is also available on YouTube.</p><p>The album is also available for purchase through <a aria-label="Swift's website (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Swift's website</a>, <a href=#>Target</a>, <a href=#>Walmart</a>, and Record Store Day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZWmEcoOTaKuasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWjpLuoecSmpJplo6m8r7GO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robert-myers.html><span>←</span><span>Robert Myers (offensive lineman)</span></a>
