In his memoir, Luck or Something Like It, Kenny explained that he was just nineteen years old when he became a father. Janice's parents, however, were not thrilled with her pregnancy. The pair married in 1958 and divorced in 1960.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Shortly after their divorce, Kenny told Fox News that in retrospect, he agreed to keep his distance to allow Carole's stepfather to become the father she deserved, "He stepped in at a time that was really awkward for all of us, and he became her Dad, and I love him for that."
