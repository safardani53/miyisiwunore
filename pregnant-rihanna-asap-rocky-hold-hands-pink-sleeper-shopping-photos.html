The rapper, 34, also rocked a pair of brown suede loafers that appeared to be from Gucci’s popular Adidas collaboration that dropped last spring.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Rihanna has yet to confirm if she is expecting a boy or a girl, but possibly dropped a hint earlier in the day while shopping at Kitson Kids. The Barbados native was seen looking at a knit pink sleeper in a photo snapped, perhaps hinting that baby number two is going to be a little girl.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/rihanna-asap-rocky-baby-shopping-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Super Bowl halftime performer</a> gave birth to her first child, a son, on May 13, 2022 in Los Angeles. She finally revealed the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>little boy’s face</a> in an adorable TikTok last December as she teased him for trying to take her iPhone! Since, she’s shared a few photos here and there of the baby — now 11 months — but has yet to reveal his name.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>She’s also revealed motherhood has been “amazing” for her. “It is crazy. It is amazing. … It’s weird. It’s all of those things, all at once. The best feeling, the best. The most love I’ve ever known. I can’t describe it. It’s new. It’s fascinating. Every step, every facial expression, every new milestone. I love it,” she said at Fenty Beauty event in Nov. 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“I thought I was getting better at patience, but this will sit you down. You are forced to be patient as a mom, as a parent, just in general,” she also said. “Your tolerance level goes down, but your patience goes up, if that makes any sense.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH11e5BrZqmqlZy7orrTZqmioJGju6J5wKyYqWWipLCsxYyhpqWcXZ2ur7DSZqeipptiwK2xxKmcq2WjnbyxvMinnmaomKTBsL%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lisa-foiles.html><span>←</span><span>Lisa Foiles Biography</span></a>
