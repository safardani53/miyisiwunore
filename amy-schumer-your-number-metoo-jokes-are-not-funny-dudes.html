I don’t know the new rules,’ STOP," Amy writes.</p><p>These men may be attempting topical humor or even masking genuine questions with a joke, but Amy says that it has to stop.</p><p>"What you are doing," she explains. "Is belittling victims who have been wronged."</p><p>Zero of the women who shared their stories of fear and trauma were hoping that it made good fodder for some dude’s joke.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Amy then lays down some statistics on sexual assault.</p><p>"They say 1 in 6 women in our country have been sexually assaulted," Amy shares before adding. "That’s based on who reports it."</p><p>Rape is massively underreported, and Amy shares: "It’s been proven to be closer to 1 in 3."</p><p>That is important because any man who is telling a joke like this around almost any number of women has a statistical likelihood of telling this joke to a survivor.</p><p>How many people give polite smiles or laughter because they don’t want to feel like a wet blanket? Too many.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"Stop making fun of the terror and indignity most of us have faced in our lives," Amy pleads.</p><p>In this case, she’s not just speaking of sexual assault and sexual harassment.</p><p>She is also speaking of the almost universal fear of both that comes from being a woman who is aware of how prevalent these evils can be.</p><p>Amy continues: "Again RBG quotes Sarah Grimke, I ask no favors for my sex. All I ask for my brethren is that they take their feet off our necks."</p><p>Too often, civil rights for marginalized inviduals are framed as special rights. They’re not. People just want to be safe and equal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Amy acknowledges that some men, plagued by toxic and patriarchal attitudes in our culture, may genuinely have questions about what is and is not okay.</p><p>"If you’re confused about the new rules, just ask and don’t make it a joke," Amy suggests.</p><p>Ask a trusted friend who is comfortable answering your questions. Maybe even try a thoughtful Google search.</p><p>"Because that’s harmful," Amy explains.</p><p>"And," she continues. "We don’t want to hear that kind of joke right now."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The kind of "jokes" to which she refers have been made by comedians who should know better and by actors who should know better.</p><p>The recent news that Henry Cavill will play Geralt of Rivia in Netflix’s The Witcher adaptation was exciting, but marred by the memory that he had joked that he was unsure of how to ask out a woman thanks to #MeToo.</p><p>It’s not that people think that Cavill is a predator — it’s that people don’t like to see famous man pretending to equate flirtation with harassment.</p><p>Again, find a thoughtful and appropriate time and way to ask — and make sure that it’s someone who is comfortable giving you an honest answer.</p><p>And if you’ve already made a joke like that, that doesn’t mean that you’re irredeemable. Just stop. We’re all learning and growing as human beings.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>17 Reasons Why We Adore Amy Schumer</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WGcK3MsmSsm5iquqa%2BjLKmrqpdo8KursSrZKadpKS8brbOpJysZZGnsm66zq1kn62eo8ZusNSdnKxn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-shaun-martin-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Shaun Martin Dating Now</span></a>
