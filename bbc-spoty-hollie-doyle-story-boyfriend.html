They compete in the same races for the same prizes and same prize funds.</p><p>All year long Doyle has shown she not only deserves to be at the top of the sport, but in the No 1 spot.</p><p>She even beat her boyfriend Tom Marquand into first place on more than one occasion!</p><p>It is all a very far cry from her humble beginnings where she picked up the reins on ponies and farm animals.</p><p>But racing runs in the blood, her dad Mark was a jockey and mum Caroline was a regular on the Arab Racing circuit.</p><p>The family had a number of ponies and as soon as Doyle was walking she’d be on a horse too.</p><p>As the years passed she became one of the names to look out for on the pony circuit - where many of racing’s top jocks have cut their teeth.</p><p>And she soon met fellow rider Marquand.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">A decade later and the pair are loved-up in their Hungerford household, winning big races for fun</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Horse Racing</h2></p><p>Dubbed racing’s power couple, the love birds have been in top form all summer long.</p><p>Both were in with a shot at becoming Champion Jockey this season, but Oisin Murphy and Will Buick were just too strong.</p><p>But Marquand, 22, still had a season to remember, winning his first Group 1 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">when pummeling the Aussies down under with Addeybb</a>.</p><p>A few months later and the pair both had a memorable Royal Ascot as they landed their first ever Royal winners.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000592401750.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000592404958.jpg><p>The following month Doyle made more headlines as she grabbed her first <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Group race on Dame Malliot at Newmarket’s July Meeting</a>.</p><p>The momentum didn’t stop there. Soon owner Imad Al Sagar made Doyle his number one retained jockey and she quickly ensured that was the right call as Extra Elusive won at Group level.</p><p>That was part of an incredible <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">899-1 five-timer at Windsor that again shot Doyle</a> into the news across the board.</p><p>But arguably the best was yet to come. British Champions Day is one of the biggest days in the racing calendar and they took it by storm.</p><p>Four of the six races were won by the couple, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bagging over a million quid in prize money.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3c3f2aa6-3b77-4ee9-b939-a5fa911c82e8.jpg><p>And don't expect them to slow down anytime soon.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Doyle has such a high standing in racing now that people back her to win rather than a horse.</p><p>With a massive fan base cheering her on, don't be surprised to see her upset the odds in SPOTY and beat Lewis Hamilton to the title.</p><p>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.
