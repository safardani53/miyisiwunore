Buyer</strong></a> told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>, “Brooke Burke’s gorgeous engagement ring looks to feature a 5.0 to 6.0-carat Brilliant Round diamond in a Pavé Setting with larger diamonds along the band. A unique twist on a classic style, the setting enhances the striking beauty of the center stone. Depending on the quality and specific characteristics of the diamond, we estimate the cost of the ring between approximately $175,000 to $325,000. The timeless engagement ring compliments her necklaces, which she has layered – a trend we’re seeing. The necklace appears to be a diamond bezel set layered with a gold statement chain.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Clearly, it’ll be a birthday she’ll never forget. “Following my birthday bliss, so thankful for family, friends & of course birthday cake,” she captioned a few shots from the party that she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared on Instagram</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Scott and Brooke <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>started dating</a> in 2019.
