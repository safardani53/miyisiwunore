The singer, 24, threw a Gotham-themed party, and dressed up as DC Comics character Poison Ivy for the fun occasion.

She also asked the crowd to sing along before performing a newer song, but “the sound was awful,” according to our insider. “She sang three songs in total before security rushed her out of the building with the hot dancer in tow,” the eyewitness tells us.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/BpbNW74huI-/?taken-by=iamhalsey</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The party came just three days after news broke that Halsey and&nbsp;<strong>G-Eazy</strong> split up for the second time. However, the singer “seemed unfazed and not bothered at all by her recent breakup” at the party, our source says. “She was all smiles and seemed to be relaxed and in a great mood.” The insider also says Halsey appeared “to feel sexy and confident” in her Poison Ivy outfit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH5xe5FwZqGZnKiyunnPmqmtoZWoerS0yKurpZ2jqHqusc1mn5qknKTEprHNZp5mnZGvxm6%2Fz6WgrWWgpLa0u81moK%2BxXZi8tMDUppxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./camel-toe-knickers-exist.html><span>←</span><span>Camel toe knickers now exist and people don't know what to make of them</span></a>
