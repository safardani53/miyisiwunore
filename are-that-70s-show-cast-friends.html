It’s hard to believe more than two decades have passed."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

And ironically, several of the show’s very famous cast members were around that same age when the period sitcom first aired.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>They need little introduction, but here’s a refresher on the who’s who. The main characters included <a href=#>Topher Grace</a> as Eric Forman; Laura Prepon as Donna Pinciotti; Mila Kunis as Jackie Burkhart; <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher</a> as Michael Kelso; <a href=#>Danny Masterson</a> as Steven Hyde; and, of course, <a href=#>Wilmer Valderrama</a> as foreign exchange student Fez.</p><p>Their onscreen chemistry as a group of teenage friends growing up in Wisconsin was magic, but as actors, it’s their job and talent to make that happen.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">But are the ‘That ‘70s Show’ cast friends in real life?</h2><p>That’s a good question! The quick answer is yes. I mean, they did work together for eight seasons, after all.</p><p>They kept in touch following the show’s finale, and were shown enjoying each other’s company in a widely shared and much-loved group photo. It shows the gang gathered together for a sing-along hangout back in 2013.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Reflecting on the show’s 20th anniversary in August 2018, Wilmer took to Instagram to show love for his cast mates, who he calls family.&nbsp;</p><p>Wilmer’s caption reads, “August 23, 1998.. this was the first picture we ever took together, 20 years ago today... We had just met and had no idea what was ahead of us, or if it would even last.. but we knew it was gonna be fun.
