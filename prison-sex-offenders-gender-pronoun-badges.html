HMP Isle of Wight has been accused of woke “pandering”.
It unveiled six purple badges with pronouns such as “he/they”, “her/they” and “they/them”. Also included are more conventional ones “she/her” and “he/him”.
Another just says “ask me” on it. The move has ­coincided with National Inclusion Week, which began yesterday.
The prison said on Twitter: “In preparation for National Inclusion Week our equalities team have started ­distributing pronoun badges."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
