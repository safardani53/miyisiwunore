and Meghan Markle stepped down from their roles as senior members of the royal family.</p><p>The couple’s transition to civilian life certainly hasn’t been easy, and they’ve encountered quite a few major obstacles along the way.</p><p>But we think any honest observer, when assessing the couple’s time in America, would have to admit that these two racked up more wins than losses.</p><p>And apparently, several members of the royal family are shocked that the Sussexes have enjoyed such favorable results.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>According to a <a href=#>new article</a> by longtime royal reporter Omid Scobie, the royals fully expected Harry to fall flat on his face in America.</p><p>“Not everybody believed in Harry’s decision,” Scobie writes.</p><p><br>“Few within his own family and the palace thought it was a good idea, many had their own dramatic predictions about how disastrous a move to the US could be.</p><p>“Honestly, he’s setting himself up to fail,” Scobie recalls “a very senior aide” telling him shortly after the Sussexes arrived in the States.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/meghan-and-harry-at-the-invictus-games-812x1024.jpg><p>“Without all of this, it’s impossible,” the source continued, gesturing meaningfully to the walls of Buckingham Palace.</p><p>Not surprisingly, it seems the royals were convinced that money would be the biggest hurdle standing between the Sussexes and a life of true independence.</p><p>By stepping down from their royal duties, Harry and Meghan opted out of receiving money from the publicly-funded Sovereign Grant.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/06/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-clap-1024x985.jpg><p>Many within the Windsors’ inner circle felt that it would be impossible for Harry and Meghan to devote themselves full-time to their humanitarian endeavors without access to the fund that previously bankrolled their lifestyle.</p><p>Insiders told Scobie that they believed it would be only a matter of time before the Sussexes would be forced to accept money from the “wrong” places in order to remain afloat.</p><p>“But two years later, and without a penny from the British taxpayer, Harry has created the life he has long dreamed about,” Scobie writes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The key to this success, of course, has been the Sussexes’ business acumen.</p><p>Long before they touched down in the States, Harry and Meghan had several lucrative deals in the works.</p><p>They’ve partnered with Better Up, Spotify, and Netflix, with a <a href=#>docuseries about the Sussexes’ home life</a> reportedly slated for release before the end of the year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-in-nyc-1007x1024.jpg><p>And of course, there’s <a href=#>Harry’s highly-anticipated memoir</a>, which is also scheduled for a late-2022 launch.</p><p>In other words, the best is yet to come in terms of Harry and Meghan’s lucrative relationship with the American media.</p><p>Obviously, that’s good news for the Sussexes, and major cause for concern for their rivals back in the UK.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Scobie says that despite rumors to the contrary, Harry’s book will not contain any “attacks” against his relatives or the royal family as an institution.</p><p>Sources close to the Duke of Sussexes say he has zero interest in deepening the rift that has divided the two factions of the Windsor clan for so long.</p><p>Instead, he seeks only to tell the story of his life as openly and honestly as possible.</p><p>And the fact that royals are terrified of him doing so is rather telling.</p><ul
