She’s been doing everything in her power to get him help always, the whole family has.” The 32-year-old was recently seen looking <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>noticeably slimmer on Halloween</a> as well as at older sister <strong>Kim</strong>‘s 39th birthday party, and looked healthier and happier than he has in years!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Rob’s dramatic weight gain happened during a bout of depression, and, at his heaviest, he admitted he hit a whopping 250 pounds.

Kim and Khloe especially tried to be the peacemakers in all of that. They really went to bat for Rob and understood where he was coming from. Kylie also really related, too.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Rob certainly looked like his old self again on Halloween, and mama Kris is his biggest cheerleader!&nbsp;“Kris is so proud of Rob and really happy he’s being more social again.
