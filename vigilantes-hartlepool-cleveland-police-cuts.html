Middlesbrough, around 15 miles away.</p><p>There are now just 10 officers on duty overnight in the town, which has a population of 92,000, while their cars sit empty without enough officers to fill them.</p><p>A BBC News investigation found that on a recent Saturday night, all 10 officers were dealing with incidents and there was no one left to emergency calls.</p><p>At one stage, four officers were driving prisoners to Middlesbrough at the same time.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">How crime has risen in Hartlepool</h3></p><p>THE number of crimes reported in Hartlepool during the last year has increased by 19 per cent.</p><p>Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that 10,757 crimes were recorded from the year to March.</p><p>This means a rate of 116 crimes per 1,000 residents during 2017 to 2018 - above the England and Wales average of 82.</p><p>Gun and knife possession offences rose from 2o to 73 incidents, while theft shot up by 19 per cent.</p><p>The latest police figures also reveal the number of robberies between&nbsp;April 2017 and March 2018 more than doubled.</p><p>There were 99 robberies - including violent muggings - in the period, which is an increase of 115.2 per cent in 2016-2017 when 46 were reported.</p><p>Hartlepool also has the highest level of crime across the force area.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000450927612.jpg><p>Hartlepool mayor Allan Barclay told the <a href=# rel=noopener>Daily Mail</a>: "Criminals are very happy because they know they can get away with it.</p><p>"Policing is now non-existent for low-level crimes and things like burglaries and shoplifting because the police’s hands are tied by budget cuts.</p><p>"Police have effectively given up on coming out because they just don’t have the resources – victims get a crime number and that’s it."</p><p>One volunteer Stephen Picton, 47, said: "We don't want to be here, we have to be here.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000450927967.jpg><p>"We are all full time workers but are giving up a few hours in the night just to protect what is ours and to protect everyone else.</p><p>"We are not police but basically we are doing their job."</p><p>The locals insist they are purely a deterrent and hope their presence will prevent crimes happening in the first place.</p><p>The most recent crime figures showed that public disorder offences in the town increased by 98 to 185, a rise of more than 112 per cent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000306719046.jpg><p>Local councillors said there were not enough bobbies on the beat to cope.</p><p>Councillor Rob Cook said: "I'm aware we have less police than have ever had before.</p><p>"You don't see PCSOs or police on the street much these days.</p><p>"One of the other problems is people need to report crimes.</p><p>"In my ward there is a shop owner facing problems but he doesn't ring up because he knows he's wasting his time.</p><p>"By the time police get there they've gone or they won't be able to find who did it."</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Brazen Hartlepool thief Nathan Beddow on CCTV hiding Poppy Appeal tin down his trousers</span><p>The figures showed a 3 per cent overall rise in crime from April to June compared to the same time last year.</p><p>Hartlepool are not the only town to take matters into their own hands when it comes to crime.</p><p>Community watchdog group We Stand Determined <a href=#>hit 1,500 members last week as it called for Birmingham residents to report dangers they were facing.</a></p><p>The group was originally launched after an unsuccessful petition to get more police in the area.</p><p>Organisers Wayne, Tracy and Michael turned vigilante after discovering a friend had been attacked in his home in Birmingham by thieves armed with hammers.</p><p>They now organise twice-weekly patrols across the city and insist the group is non-violent and seeks to work in partnership with the police, not against it.</p><img

in the wake of violent stabbings, shootings and murders across the city.</p><p>Cleveland's Police and Crime Commissioner Barry Coppinger last month repeated his call for more funding for the force, which has seen a crime rise of 19 per cent in a year.</p><p>He said: “I have campaigned to secure increased funding for policing in Cleveland for years and it is a drum I will continue to beat to get a fair deal for our residents."</p><p>A force spokesman said the custody suite closure would take place in early 2019, but it could be reopened if needed.</p><p>He said the move would "reduce costs and make savings".</p><p>Assistant Chief Constable Adrian Roberts said the time needed for officers to travel between the two towns "can be managed appropriately".</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>It comes as Treasury insiders indicated <a href=#>they were prepared to give police vital funding to tackle the bloodbath on Britain's streets.</a></p><p>Violent crime has<a href=#>&nbsp;soared by nearly 20 per cent over the past year</a>&nbsp;with shock increases in rape, murder and knife attacks.</p><p>Shockingly,&nbsp;69,000 kids were wounded in the 12 months to June in Wild West Britain - up by 4,000 the previous year.</p><p>National crime survey figures show homicide is up by 14 per cent while knife possession has increased by 21 per cent.</p><p>Murders in London have reached their highest in more than a decade, with more than 100 victims in 2018 so far.</p><p><b>We pay for your stories!
