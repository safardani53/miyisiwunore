So naturally, this made people think if Miller had a wife&nbsp;or not.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>No, Miller does not have a wife, and he has not married to date. However, he was close to marrying someone and calling her his wife.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Von Miller posing for a picture in his Los Angeles Ram uniform. </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>The NFL player was together with an Instagram model named&nbsp;Megan Denise since 2018. According to <a href=# rel="follow noopener">The Sun</a>, she was a stripper at the Las Vegas club called Girl Collection club.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She worked there in 2017 for almost a year before being an Instagram influencer. She is also a certified laser specialist, licensed medical esthetician, and cryo skin specialist. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Denise has dipped her toes in acting as well and has appeared in a couple of projects like Typecasted, Private Investigations, Bikini Mayhem, and Fates of Ambitions.</p><p>After dating for a while, Miller and Denise&nbsp;were engaged. However, the two parted ways and are&nbsp;not together anymore.</p><p>It is unknown when they broke up,&nbsp;but it was at least before January 2021 because that is when the public feuding and scandals started.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Von Miller's&nbsp;ex-fiancée Megan Denise and son Valor. </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><h2>Feud Between Von Miller and His Ex-Fiancée</h2><p>On January 4, 2021, Denise claimed via Instagram that she was pregnant with Miller's child. She then exposed a couple of texts between her and her ex-fiancée where he allegedly did not want the kid.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Miller texted her he was disappointed in himself and said it was the "biggest mistake" of his life. He also claimed&nbsp;he was "honestly praying for a miscarriage."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The texts also showed that the NFL player was urging Denise to get an abortion. He also called her&nbsp;lame for wanting to keep the baby.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The Instagram model tried to reason with him saying, that she had wanted to get pregnant for a long time. She said she was beyond disappointed in him and posted a photo of her ultrasound saying, "JUST US."</p><p>She wrote on her Instagram stories that she was tired of protecting him. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In another story, she wrote, "My heart goes out to any woman or man who is or has ever dealt with mental, physical or verbal abuse. Praying death on me and mine was enough. Protecting me and mine all 2021."</p><p>Miller also took to Instagram Stories to respond to the allegations by his ex-fiancée. He denied all the accusations and said it was fake news.&nbsp;</p><p>He claimed it was the "reality of somebody leaving you make some people literally crazy." He deleted the story shortly after.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Regardless of all this scandal, it seems like he is currently on good terms with Denise and their son Valor. In August 2021, he gushed about Denise and said he was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">impressed</a> by her strength while giving birth to Valor.&nbsp;</p><p>He said it was "a great, great labor, great delivery," and he was impressed by her. He also said he knew it was hard to have a kid, but witnessing the birth blew his mind.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>He took a break from his training to be with his baby mama but returned shortly after.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaK6fo3qutculnKtlp56zpnrHraSl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maisy-joan-stocklin.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Erik Stocklin and Colleen Ballingers Daughter Maisy Joan Stocklin?</span></a>
