I truly try and stick to telling the truth,” Aguilera told Us on the red carpet. “And ‘Fall on Me’ is such a beautiful song with the same intent that we [had on] ‘Say Something.’ It’s just so spiritual, it’s very truthful, and I think it is a song that truly connects with people who are looking for something, searching for something, digging for meaning in their lives, and that’s what connects us.”</p><p>A Great Big World, meanwhile, could not stop raving over Xtina. “What is there not to love? She’s got one of the most iconic voices, and I still gotta pinch myself sometimes that I get to sing with her,” Axel, 34, told Us. “She’s just a real artist and she really connects to the music when she sings it, and I feel that and [Chad] feels that and it’s just organic and there’s magic that happens.”</p><p>King, also 34, echoed, “I think with this song in particular, she takes it to a different level. I’ve never heard her sing like this, and it’s so perfect. It’s bigger than any of us could have ever dreamed.”</p><p></p><p>“Fall on Me” is the first new song that the former Mouseketeer has released since her eighth studio album, <a href=#>Liberation</a>, which dropped in June 2018. The record included the singles “Accelerate” featuring <strong>Ty Dolla $ign</strong> and <strong>2 Chainz</strong>, “Fall in Line” featuring <a href=#><strong>Demi Lovato</strong></a> and “Like I Do” featuring <strong>GoldLink</strong>.</p><p>Aguilera has been busy on the road as of late — her X tour wraps on December 7 and her Xperience residency in Las Vegas runs through March 6, 2020 — but she still makes sure to spend plenty of time with her two children. She shares son Max, 11, with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Jordan Bratman</strong></a> and daughter Summer, 5, with fiancée <a href=#><strong>Matthew Rutler</strong></a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“When I’m on stage, there’s not a bigger high, when I’m in connection with my voice and my heart and my soul,” she told <a href=#>Billboard</a> in May 2018. “But at the end [of a performance], I want to wipe it all off, get in my <a href=# data-link=1>sweatpants</a>, make silly noises with my kids and have someone comfort and cuddle me.”</p><p>With reporting by Kayley Stumpe</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqhqpmowaq6wGaYoK2ZobKzrYywn7JlmWKwsLjLmpmoqpGpsqV51qKroWWRYrSzscCtZJuhl2LEsL7LnWSan5Geu3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brewster-h-shaw-19450516-html.html><span>←</span><span>Brewster H.
