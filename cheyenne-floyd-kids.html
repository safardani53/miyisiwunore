When she was a newborn, I would have to wake up every two hours and feed Ryder. With the condition, she has no side effects, but we still monitor it. She has to take medicine, she sees a specialist.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Cheyenne-Floyd-Kids-MEGA-embed-1.jpg><h2>Ace Terrell Davis</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Cheyenne shares her son Ace, who was born on May 27, 2021, with her fiance <strong>Zach Davis</strong>.
