It is not journalism," the former model said.</p><p>Dax agreed: "That Barbara Walters interview is maddening."</p><p>During the chat, Barbara grilled Brooke about her measurements, to which the teen replied: "I'm 5ft10 and 120lbs."</p><p>The broadcaster, now 92, then made Brooke stand up and stood next to the young actress to compare their body shapes.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>"I think when people see you they don't realize how tall and slim you are. We haven't really seen you standing next to someone," the host said.</p><p>Barbara then claimed Brooke's "childhood was being stolen" because of her work in the showbiz industry - something Brooke and her mom Teri denied.</p><p>The interview was filmed as part of Calvin Klein's 1980 campaign, in which Brooke caused shockwaves after saying to the camera: "You want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing."</p><h2><strong>OVERSEXUALIZED</strong></h2><p>The <a href=#>A Castle for Christmas</a> star revealed she was "naive" at the time to the double entendre - the implication that she wasn't wearing any underwear in the shoot.</p><p>"I was naive, I didn't think anything of it. I didn't think it had to do with underwear. I didn't think it was sexual in nature," Brooke told Vogue in October.</p><p>"I'd say that about my sister, nobody could come between me and my sister.</p><p>"If they had intended on the double entendre, they didn't explain it to me. It didn't faze me. It didn't sort of come into my psyche as it being anything overtly sexual, sexualized in any way."</p><h2><strong>HEALTH ISSUES</strong></h2><p>Meanwhile, earlier this year Brooke <a href=#>broke her femur</a> and had to learn to walk again using crutches.</p><p>Back in February, the model shared a video of herself in hospital and explained that she's only allowed to put about 20 percent of her full body weight on her fractured thighbone.&nbsp;</p><p>A fractured femur or thighbone is usually treated with surgery and intensive therapy and it can take months for the bone to heal.</p><p>The Suddenly Susan star married to screenwriter Chris Henchy in 2001 and they have two daughters - Rowan, 18, and Grier, 15.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000136177089.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000657529075.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Brooke Shields reveals she broke her femur as she learns how to walk again on crutches at the hospital</span><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsYmd%2BeoKVaJmrp5%2Bgsm6%2Fx6KcpZyjYsCtrcysZJuZopeus62MsJilrJWnwG6v0aKkoqaRoXq0sdeumKWhqp67qHnIp6ueqqaesrh7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-bobby-deen-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Bobby Deen Dating Now</span></a>
