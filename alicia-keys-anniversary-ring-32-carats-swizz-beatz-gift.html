The giant ring is immediately noticeable, especially because it takes up the entire space between her knuckles! We also love how excited Alicia looks in the photo, as it appears she might have been brought to tears by Swizz’s massive gift.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The next Snap is a video, and it shows Alicia shining the light from her own phone onto the stunning diamond. Swizz can’t help but reach out and hold onto Alicia’s fingers so that his camera gets a clear shot of the ring, which is breathtaking.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>Mark Keeney</strong>, VP of marketing for Ritani, dished on what the exquisite diamond would cost. “The massive 32-carat multi-million dollar ring is a head turner that would make even royalty blush. Set in platinum prongs for security, this emerald-cut diamond would appraise anywhere from 1.5 million to over 2 million dollars,” he said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Check out the Snaps below:</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The anniversary is for Alicia and Swizz’s wedding, which took place in 2010.
