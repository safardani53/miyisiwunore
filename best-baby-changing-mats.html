Some changing mats have machine washable covers, which helps if there's been a poonami incident.</p><p>It always helps to get a changing mat that can be folded up easily, especially if you're out and about a lot for sensory classes or midwife appointments. Some baby changing bags come with a changing mat so it saves the hassle of hunting another one down.</p><h2>How many baby-changing mats do you need?</h2><p>It comes down to personal preference, but it's always handy to have one changing mat in the house and one in the bag—saves at least one minute when you're trying to leave the house.</p><p>Some people might have one changing mat in the baby's room, one downstairs and one in a bag. It always helps to make sure grandparents have their own changing mats too.</p><h2>Do I need a baby changing mat?</h2><p>There isn't really a time you wouldn't need a baby-changing mat.</p><p>While you can get changing tables with mats built in, you will always need a changing mat when you go out. Portable and packable, it means that you don't need to worry about cold, hard floors or staining carpets—trust us, without a changing mat it will happen... in fact, it might happen with one.</p><h2>Where to buy baby changing mats</h2><p>You can buy baby changing mats from specialist baby and children's shops and department stores. We would recommend looking for baby-changing mats at the following stores.</p><h2>How much do baby changing mats cost?</h2><p>Baby changing mats range in price according to the brand and the quality of the materials but you can purchase a good quality changing mat for around £20.</p><p>If you do decide to splash out on a luxury baby changing mat for your little one, it's more likely to stand the test of time - and you can always pass it on to another new parent when you no longer need it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmpoYWeCcn2YaJmeq6Rir6Ku2GaaoZmenLavs4ymmK2rXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./qeaakw9zib3mxr4kohv8znszjljuke9l.html><span>←</span><span>Watch The Love Boat Season 4 Episode 15: From Here To Maternity/ Jealousy/ The Trigamist</span></a>
