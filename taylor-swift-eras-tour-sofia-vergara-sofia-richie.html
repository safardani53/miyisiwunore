Do you have 10 minutes to spare?” she asked the crowd after performing hits such as I Knew You Were Trouble and We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.</p><p>Just before the heartbreak anthem, which she belts out with just her acoustic guitar, Taylor sang the cheerful party track 22- during which she gives her black fedora hat to one lucky fan from the audience.&nbsp;</p><h2>MAMBA MENTALITY</h2><p>During her first LA show, Taylor shared an extra-special moment with <a href=#>Kobe Bryant</a>’s daughter, <a href=#>Bianka</a>, 6.&nbsp;</p><p>Bianka flashed a massive smile as Taylor approached her on the edge of the stage to place the hat on the tot’s head and even gave her a kiss on the cheek as they shared a sweet embrace.</p><p><a href=#>Taylor</a>, who was friends with the Lakers legend before his <a href=#>tragic death</a> in 2020, also invited Bianka’s mom <a href=#>Vanessa Bryant</a> as well as older sister, Natalia.</p><p>The hitmaker continued the musical journey with Grammy-winner Folklore followed by her Album Of The Year-winning record 1989.&nbsp;</p><p>When it came time for the highly-anticipated surprise acoustic set, in which Taylor does two different songs every night, the Pennsylvania native did not disappoint.&nbsp;</p><p>On Thursday night, the songwriter performed her new Speak Now (Taylor's Version) single, I Can See You, on the acoustic guitar.&nbsp;</p><p>The stadium roared with cheers as she played at her floral-painted piano for her <a href=#>Midnights</a> breakup ballad, Maroon, as the second surprise song.&nbsp;</p><p>On Friday, she switched it up by performing Our Song, a fan-favorite from her 2006 self-titled debut album as well as the 1989’s bonus track You Are In Love.&nbsp;</p><p>After diving under the stage and “swimming” to the other side for a quick outfit change, <a href=#>Taylor</a> closed her juggernaut of a concert with the Midnights album, which she released earlier this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Her single Lavender Haze opened the enchanting final portion while the upbeat track, Karma, closed out the monumental 45-song concert as confetti floated all over the football stadium and all of the performers took their well-deserved bow. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

huge buzz due to how difficult it was to score the <a href=#>high-demand tickets</a>, had some of Hollywood’s biggest names come see her rock out.&nbsp;</p><p>Newly single <a href=#>Sofia Vergara</a>, 51, attended the show on Friday with some of her closest gal pals.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=#>Modern Family</a> actress <a href=#>showed off her incredible figure</a> in a bedazzled strapless crop top with matching pants.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite her recent <a href=#>split from husband Joe Manganiello</a>, 46, the <a href=#>AGT</a> judge shared videos as she sang along to romance songs such as Love Story.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Sofia Richie</a>, 24, ditched husband <a href=#>Elliot Grainge</a>, 29, for a date night with her girlfriends as she documented her <a href=#>Eras night</a> while they all

lyrics</a> to All Too Well as she wore a little white T-shirt, jeans and large gold hoop earrings.&nbsp;</p><p>Oscar-winner Brie Larson, 33, couldn’t contain her excitement as she screamed “Taylor!” at the top of her lungs from her SoFi Stadium suite and was surrounded by other major A-list names.&nbsp;</p><p>Lupita Nyong’o, Elle Fanning, Hilary Duff, Max Greenfield, Mindy Kaling, Sarah Paulson, Ashley Tisdale, Kesha, Shay Mitchell, Paula Abdul, and Sofia’s <a href=#>Modern Family</a> co-star Jesse Tyler Ferguson also attended the first two nights of the <a href=#>LA Eras tour</a>- with
