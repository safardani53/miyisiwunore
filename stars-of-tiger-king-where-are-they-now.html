In March 2021, Joe and his husband Dillon Passage <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>announced they were divorcing</a> – but were not "in a hurry" to make their split legal, Joe told his attorney via email, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>TMZ</a>, though Exotic did end up <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>filing for divorce in March 2022</a> because of a relationship with fellow inmate John Graham. By June of that year, Exotic and Graham's engagement was no more and he was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=6>in a relationship</a> with a former boyfriend named Seth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In early November 2021, the big cat lover revealed that he had <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>been diagnosed</a> with "aggressive" prostate cancer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Right now I don't want anyone's pity and I'm sure Carole will have her own party over this," he said <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>in a statement</a> regarding the news.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In August 2022, Exotic <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>said that he hoped</a> that a new friendship <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>90 Day Fiancé</a> alum <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Jesse Meester</a> would eventually lead to a pardon from President Joe Biden.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-carole-baskin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Carole Baskin</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Carole Baskin.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Carole Baskin/Facebook</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The original Tiger King focused on the long-standing, increasingly bitter rivalry between Baskin — who runs the exotic sanctuary, Big Cat Rescue, in Citrus Park, Fla. — and Exotic, the now-imprisoned zookeeper.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Baskin's then-husband, self-made millionaire Don Lewis, vanished without a trace in August 1997, soon after the couple decided to divorce. At the time, relatives of Lewis questioned whether Baskin may have been involved and whether she may have fed his remains to her tigers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lewis' disappearance remains unsolved.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Baskin continues to run Big Cat Rescue with her husband, Howard Baskin, and competed on season 29 of Dancing with the Stars after Netflix fame made her a household name. The animal advocate <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>came out</a> as bisexual in 2020, and in September 2021 slammed Tiger King 2 as a "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>reality show dumpster fire</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The second season</a> explores theories on Don Lewis' fate, with mentions of "shady characters down in Costa Rica."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In November 2021, the Baskins filed a lawsuit against Netflix, alleging breach of contract for featuring them in Tiger King 2 and its promotional trailer, despite their refusal to participate.

Upon hearing of Exotic's financial troubles, Lowe decided to invest in the zoo and keep some of his own animals there. After Exotic filed for bankruptcy, Lowe bought the Oklahoma zoo. When he later learned that Exotic was being investigated for the murder-for-hire plot, he became an informant and his work ultimately led to Exotic's arrest.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In June 2020, Lowe was ordered by a judge to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hand over ownership</a> of the animal park to Carole Baskin.
