On top of the photo, a series of comments appeared claiming that Beyoncé’s skin looked lighter and questioned “why she looks so white.”</p><p>“How sad is it that some of her own people continue the stupid narrative with hate and jealousy,” Knowles continued. “Duh, she wore silver hair to match her silver dress as a fashion statement clown. ALIEN Superstar duh!”</p><p>After a few seconds, the image disappeared and a snippet of moments throughout her career played alongside her song “Brown Skin Girl.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Beyonce-s-Mom-Tina-Knowles-Slams-Claims-That-Her-Daughter-Lightened-Skin-for-Renaissance-Premiere-655.jpg><p>In her lengthy post, Knowles shared her disappointment for the individuals who were acting “ignorant.” She pointed out that countless “beautiful talented Black celebrities” have rocked <a href=#>platinum hair</a> since Etta James and questioned if the same trolls have accused them of “trying to be white.” Knowles confessed she was fed up with the double standard when it comes to Beyoncé.</p><p>“I am sick and tired of people attacking her. Every time she does something that she works her ass off for and is a statement of her work ethic, talent and resilience, here you sad little haters come out the woodwork,” she penned. “Jealousy and racism, sexism, double standards, you perpetuate those things. Instead of celebrating a sister or just ignoring if you don’t like her. I am sick of you losers.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Knowles acknowledged that her daughter was going to be upset about her speaking out on the matter. She concluded her message by gushing over how generous, thoughtful and a great role model Beyoncé is for their community.</p><p>In honor of her daughter’s accomplishment, Knowles was in attendance for Beyoncé’s premiere in Beverly Hills. The <a href=#>star-studded event</a> also brought out several big names and good friends of the pop star including <strong>Gabrielle Union</strong>, <strong>Chloe Bailey</strong>, <strong>Halle Bailey</strong>, <strong>Kris Jenner</strong> and others.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoZ6Weqy6zrCjnqtdmbKnsc2dqmaala68r6%2FEZpigmZmjwLV5wqWYoqWjYsCpsYyloKCgpJq7prCMrKKipl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./errol-louis.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Errol Louis net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
