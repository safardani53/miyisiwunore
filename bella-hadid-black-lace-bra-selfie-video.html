The super model channeled french design house YSL as she opted for a cropped black sweater, revealing her lace La Perla bra in a new selfie video posted on Friday, Dec. 4. “Baby you remind me of my dreams,” she coyly captioned the Instagram post, perhaps cryptically aimed at her ex. The brunette stunned as she kept her hair back in a her signature sleek ponytail, glowing with a tawny colored blush and festive glittery eye shadow.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The daughter of <strong>Yolanda Hadid</strong> finished her beauty look with a deep brown lipstick, adding to the ’90s vibe of her sexy ensemble. Bella accessorized with her 1996 birth year necklace by Mazza Boutique ($34), as well as an ultra luxe and rare vintage Bvlgari necklace worth over $30,000. The star appeared to be getting glammed up with makeup artist Sam Visser and hair stylist Jennifer Yepez ahead of an appearance at the Michael Kors store inside Macy’s.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Bella’s 35 million followers were loving the post including designer <strong>Marc Jacobs</strong>. “Bell-issima!!!” the former Louis Vuitton director commented, while friend<strong> Justine Skye</strong> simply left a heart eye emoji. “IM OBSESSED,” and “Girl of my dreams” other fans gushed on the post, which racked up over 2.7 million views. Of note, the Toronto native and Bella are both no longer following each other on social media.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The flirty video comes hot off the heels of The Weeknd’s hot new collaboration with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Rosalía</strong></a>, 27. The Spanish superstar leant her vocals to a remix of his 2019 hit <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“Blinding Lights,”</a> and the pair looked super cozy to boot on the album cover. The chemistry was off-the-charts in the new video released for the song, as The Weeknd — née <strong>Abel Tesfaye</strong> — snuggled Rosalīa from behind in his signature red blazer. The duo appeared to play lovers in the sexy new, with many fans speculating about a potential off-screen romance!</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Bella and The Weekend began their on-again, off-again romance back in 2015, last splitting in Aug. 2019. Fresh off their break-up, they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>awkwardly ran into each other</a> at Catch One nightclub, prompting Bella to leave after the Canadian-born singer showed up. The Weeknd and Bella appear to be on better terms recently, after <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bumping into each</a> other in August at rehearsals for the MTV Video Music Awards (he was performing, while she was presenting <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lady Gaga</strong></a> with the MTV Tricon Award).</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>The 24-year-old is also <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reportedly thrilled</a> for her ex after he landed the coveted Super Bowl Half-Time Show. “Bella was really happy when she heard the news that The Weeknd is going to be performing at the Super Bowl Halftime show,” a source EXCLUSIVELY told&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>about the model’s feelings. “Despite them not being together, they have a history and she’s always proud of whatever accomplishments he achieves. Bella&nbsp;can only imagine how excited he must be and how much work he’ll put into every last detail of this performance. He definitely deserves this opportunity and she knows he’s going to crush it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ze49tZpudnKGubrTAnaCdZZKhrqS3jKWYnJ1dl7%2BiedKeo5%2BhlWLDqrDEqGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kendall-jenner-flaunts-her-abs-as-fans-go-wild-over-bad-bunny-horse-riding-date.html><span>←</span><span> Kendall Jenner flaunts her abs as fans go wild over Bad Bunny horse riding date Tue 4 April 202</span></a>
