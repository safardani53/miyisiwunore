The Florida- and Los Angeles-based shows air on Netflix, while the New York show is exclusively on Discovery Plus.</p><p>The agents on Selling Sunset work for The Oppenheim Group brokerage (and the Selling Tampa personalities are at Allure Realty), while the Discovery Plus stars are part of Nest Seekers International.</p><p>Selling the Hamptons will highlight the most recent peak selling season, which took place between Memorial Day and Labor Day in 2021.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p><span>Source: YouTube / Discovery Plus</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Selling the Hamptons' star J.B. Andreassi shared how the show is different from other real estate programs.</h2><p>Though the title of the new series is reminiscent of other real estate shows we've seen before, agent J.B. noted that Selling the Hamptons stands out from the rest in several key ways.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Our show is real. It's authentic. I can't speak for the other shows, but we actually live and breathe this thing — day to day, minute to minute," J.B. said about why Selling the Hamptons offers a "different" perspective on the typical real estate reality show format.</p><p>The agent, who was born and raised in Southampton, also noted that the real estate market in the popular summer destination is entirely unique.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"It's really challenging for younger agents and brokers to break into the Hamptons market," he revealed. "A lot of our clients are more private, they don't like the limelight, and they try to get away from that because they're faced with it in New York City — which is where they reside for eight months of the year. They come out to the Hamptons escape that."</p><p>"It's challenging for us to really make a difference and compete against some of the brokers out here that have been doing it for 30 or 40 years," he added.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Several of the 'Selling the Hamptons' agents first appeared on 'Million Dollar Beach House.'</h2><p>Though Selling the Hamptons is a brand-new series, Netflix subscribers will recognize J.B. and his co-stars Michael Fulfree, Peggy Zabakolas, and Jimmy Giugliano (who appears as a guest) from <a href=#>Million Dollar Beach House</a>.</p><p>Like Selling the Hamptons, Million Dollar Beach House also followed a group of Hamptons-based Nest Seekers agents as they attempted to move properties during the peak selling season. Million Dollar Beach House ran for one season in 2020.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>While the show didn't return to Netflix for a second season, three of the main stars did continue to film for the upcoming Discovery Plus series (agent Noel Roberts is not part of Selling the Hamptons). The returning agents are joined by Bianca D'Alessio, Kenny Arias, and Mia Calabrese on Selling the Hamptons.</p><p>New episodes of Selling the Hamptons debut on Thursdays on Discovery Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuv8Slo6Kml2LBqbGMoZimqKSku7R50Z6jmqyVmXq1u4ysnKWkmaO0br%2FUp6qerA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-year-old-texas-boy-fatally-struck-by-car-on-first-day-of-school-7629172.html><span>←</span><span>15-Year-Old Texas Boy Fatally Struck by Car on First Day of School</span></a>
