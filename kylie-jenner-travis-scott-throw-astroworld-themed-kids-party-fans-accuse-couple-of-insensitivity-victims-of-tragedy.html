So it’s not surprising that Kylie recently decided to multi-task for hosting a duel birthday party for both of her children, Stormi, 5, and Aire, 1.
Kylie posted some pics of the occasion on Instagram this week, and we think it’s safe to say that she did not expect the response that she received."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
