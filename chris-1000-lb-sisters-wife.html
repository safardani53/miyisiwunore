The pair met before TLC came into their lives.</h2><p>While his siblings haven’t always been lucky in love, Chris met his match in 2012. After accepting <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a management position at McDonald’s</a>, Chris connected with a fellow manager, Brittany. Chris and Brittany quickly formed a friendship, which eventually turned into them dating and getting engaged in 2016.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Brittany and Chris tied the knot on Oct. 15, 2016, four years before 1000-lb Sisters debuted in January 2020. They seemingly don’t have any children together, although Brittany is a stepmother to Chris’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">adult children, Brandon and Emily</a>. The pair also have a grandson, Iris, with whom they snapped a photo in January 2022.</p><p>“I want to thank his momma for bringing this boy in my life and God cause I didn’t even know how much I needed him in my life!! I want to wish Iris, aka my boy,” Chris captioned under a photo of him, Brittany, and Iris. “HAPPY Bday from PAPPY.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brittany’s Facebook account</a>, she still works at McDonald's as a manager.
