<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Dolores Catania Reveals Goal Weight After Losing 20 Lbs on Mounjaro</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=#><strong>Dolores Catania</strong></a> has dropped 20 pounds while taking the weight loss drug Mounjaro — and she isn’t done yet.</p><p>The Real Housewives of New Jersey star, 52, revealed that her goal weight is “to be in the low 130s,” telling <a href=#>The U.S. Sun</a> on Sunday, July 16, “I’m being realistic. Right now, I’m 137. I was 157 when I started.”</p><p>Catania originally started to shed pounds after being on Ozempic for two years. She has since switched to Mounjaro — and <a href=#>hopes to lose more weight</a>.</p><p>“I took Ozempic, stopped and then began Mounjaro. I was medically prescribed for both because I am insulin resistant, pre-diabetic and have a thyroid issue,” Catania said, adding that she was previously “gaining weight every month” before trying the medications. “It doesn’t happen overnight. It doesn’t come off easy.”</p><p>The Bravo star claimed she has also <a href=#>prioritized exercise, healthy meals and less drinking.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/RHONJ-s-Dolores-Catania-Details-Plans-to-Lose-More-Weight-After-Dropping-20-Lbs-on-Mounjaro-inline.jpg><p>“I stopped taking [Ozempic] because it was expensive and everything. But being healthy and living a healthy lifestyle is cheap — it’s free!” she shared. “I work out regularly. There is no easy fix for weight loss and I have to watch what I eat.”</p><p>Catania told <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> earlier this year that <a href=#>she took semaglutide to avoid coming to the RHONJ reunion</a> “looking any bigger than anyone else.”</p><p>The reality star went on to say that she has only experienced one major side effect, adding, “[I’m] just not hungry.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Catania’s costar <a href=#><strong>Jackie Goldschneider</strong></a> publicly called out people who took Ozempic not for its intended purpose. (The medication is used to help diabetes patients with weight management.)</p><p>“I can talk about Ozempic all day. It gets me so fired up,” Goldschneider, 46, said during a February episode of the “Virtual Reali-Tea” podcast. “I’m horrified by it. I’m not so much horrified by people wanting to lose weight — that has always been a universal thing — but I’m very, very scared of what will happen if and when people have to go off this drug.”</p><p>She continued: “It’s just going to be a massive number of people who gain a huge amount of weight and suddenly don’t know what to do with themselves. I’m just afraid of that day. There’s going to be a lot of people with eating disorders. You start dropping massive amounts of weight. That’s so addicting. That’s how I spiraled into anorexia. You get addicted to this new body and to the attention that comes with it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Goldschneider, who has been <a href=#>candid about her struggle with anorexia</a>, said her recovery has been affected by the Ozempic craze.</p><p>“From a selfish standpoint, I wanted to come back into a world where everyone around me was eating and loving food and enjoying life,” the attorney noted. “I wanted to come back to that and I didn’t because a lot of people in the Housewives world are on Ozempic. A lot of my friends are in the Housewives world, so it was tough for me to come back and suddenly no one’s eating when we go out to dinner.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGadp5ykv6a%2FjJyYrZmenq5uvsSvnJqko2K0sK3LZq6eoZedwW6txa2cq2WcpMCqusZmaWllnJfAbrvNZqSorZ6frrO7jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./westminster-police-touching-note-london-terror-attack.html><span>←</span><span>Westminster police officer shares touching note handed to him after London terror attack</span></a>
