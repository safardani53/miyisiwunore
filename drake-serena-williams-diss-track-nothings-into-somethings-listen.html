Did I just read that you just got engaged on me? I heard from your friend, you couldn’t even tell me,” said the rapper&nbsp;in the song, seemingly upset that he had to hear about Serena being off the market through the grapevine. On top of that, he makes it sound like he wanted to marry her himself, but he just wasn’t ready yet, saying “Or better yet, wait on me.”</p><h3><a href=#>Alexis & Serena: See Pics Of The Happy Couple</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Least, do I get an invitation or something? A statement or something?” He even implies&nbsp;thar Serena was hanging out with Alexis while dating him, saying “Ask about that, you would say it was nothing. But here’s another nothing that you made into something. Can’t just leave it off that way.” Yikes! The report also brings attention to the fact that Alexis’ Reddit username is Kn0thing, and Serena even posted a picture of two robots kissing, even calling herself the “Future Mrs. Kn0thing.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://twitter.com/HustleLin/status/814680377646346241</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>We didn’t think that Drake was still that hung up on Serena because he’s dated <strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong> since then and seemed to be really hot and heavy for a while, but maybe the tennis star really is the one that got away!</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you think that Drake’s song is about Serena?
