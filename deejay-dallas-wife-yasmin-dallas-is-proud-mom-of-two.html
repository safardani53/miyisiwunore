After all, she is the daughter of a football coach and former player.</strong></p><p>The FSU coach Ron Dugans’ oldest daughter, Yasmin, married the Seattle Seahawks running back in 2020. The couple has since become parents twice, with their first child born in 2019 and their second last year.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/deejay-dallas-seattle-seahawks.jpg><p>A fan favorite, Deejay Dallas’ promotional photo before the game against Carolina Panthers made the entire CSB Studio laugh, with the running back staring wide-eyed in the snap and raising his eyebrows.&nbsp;</p><p>Seahawks ended up defeating Carolina Panthers 37-27, with Deejay attempting two rushes, going for seven yards. He is currently a backup for <a href=# rel=noopener>Kenneth Walker III</a> and is trying his best to nail the running back position.&nbsp;</p><h2>Deejay Dallas Wife, Yasmin Dallas, Comes From A Football Family</h2><p>Deejay Dallas’ wife, Yasmin Dallas, grew up in a household that treasured the sports that her husband plays now. Yasmin is the daughter of the FSU football coach Ron Dugans.&nbsp;</p><p>During his heyday, Ron Dugans was a standout receiver for Florida State and was drafted in the third round by the Cincinnati Bengals. His NFL career was short-lived, lasting only two seasons.</p><p>He signed with the Houston Texans but didn’t get the chance to play for the side. Dugans then focused his attention on becoming a coach. He started with Georgia Southern Eagles and later joined the FSU team as a graduate assistant.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/deejay-dalls-wife-yasmin-dallas.jpg><p>He worked with the Bengals, Georgia Southern Eagles, Louisville, South Florida, and Miami Hurricanes and returned to FSU in 2019. And it wouldn’t be wrong to say that Ron played the matchmaker between Deejay and his daughter.&nbsp;</p><p>Deejay and Dugans crossed paths when Dugans was a wide receiver coach for the Miami Hurricanes. It was said that Dugans was a big fan of Deejay and trusted him so much that he let him date his oldest daughter.&nbsp;</p><p>As stated by <a href=# rel=noopener>The Athletic</a>, Deejay and Yasmin began dating the summer before Deejay’s freshman season in Miami.</p><p>Yasmin is available on <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> with the username @yasmin.mone and usually shares pictures of her everyday outings or that of her cute little family.&nbsp;</p><h2>Deejay And Yasmin Are Parents Of Two Kids</h2><p>Deejay and Yasmin began dating in 2016, and since then, the two have married and welcomed two kids.</p><p>With the couple’s oldest picture on Instagram dating back to 2021, they haven’t shared snaps of them during the early stages of their relationship, unlike some other couples.</p><p>After three years of dating, the running back went down on one knee in 2019, asking Yasmin to become his wife. But before their wedding, the couple welcomed their first child, Deejay Dallas Jr.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/deejay-dallas-kids.jpg><p>In an interview with the Seahawks website, Deejay said that as he had his son during the final year of college, it was hectic at first. But he and Yasmin were able to get through it.&nbsp;</p><p>The young dad said since the birth of his son, he had a change in mentality. One of his first thoughts would be how could he better himself for his son.&nbsp;</p><p>Deejay and Yasmin exchanged their vows on June 8, 2021, in a private ceremony surrounded by family and friends.</p><p>Yasmin has shared pictures of their ceremony on her Facebook handle. Ron also shared a <a href=# rel=noopener>video</a> of the Daddy-Daughter Dance on his Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple welcomed their second child, Dakoda Dallas, last year. Earlier this year, with the couple celebrating their second anniversary, Deejay shared a family photo of him and Yasmin with their two kids.</p><p>The running back captioned the post, “Two years and a couple of knuckleheads later.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCwxJ6hmrFdma6tuMCsZLChlpp6uq3SpqCnZZSWua2t0magrGWgp7y2sIympqZln5t6tcPOaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cynthia-nixon-reveals-what-her-wife-thinks-of-her-sex-scenes.html><span>←</span><span>Cynthia Nixon Reveals What Her Wife Thinks of Her Sex Scenes</span></a>
