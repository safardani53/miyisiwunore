They say promotion will mean an increase in revenue of at least £135million, which could rise to £265m over a five-year period.</p><p>So yes, winning this one could be considered important…</p><p>But it's not all about the money. This clash between Coventry and Luton Town is also somewhat of a fairytale considering it was a League Two fixture as recently as 2018.</p><p>Both now have a crack at returning to the big time and playing in the top-flight of English football for the first time in decades.</p><p>Luton enter the contest as 7/5 favourites having finished third with 80 points, and subsequently reversed a one-goal deficit to beat Sunderland at the semi-final stage.</p><p>They are also unbeaten in this fixture in their last nine meetings, winning four and drawing the other five. But beware, the team that's finished third in the Championship has lost this fixture on FIVE of the last EIGHT occasions.</p><p>Coventry, meanwhile, are 11/5 underdogs and confidence will be sky high having lost just <strong>ONCE</strong> in their last 19 matches under Mark Robins.</p><h3>Scrappy…</h3><p>As you might expect, this will be tight. The pressure on these kinds of clashes are so immense that we're rarely treated to a deluge of goals. In fact, 10 of the last 11 have been decided by a one-goal margin.</p><p>Only champions Burnley conceded less goals than Luton over the 46-match Championship campaign, while Coventry shipped just three in their final five league games with two successive clean sheets against Middlesbrough.</p><p>Four of their last seven meetings have ended in draws, and only two saw more than two goals scored inside 90 minutes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1164983987.jpg><h3>Winner…</h3><p>There has to be one! And we're going for Coventry to snatch a dramatic victory. Luton will have plenty of the ball and should dominate large portions of the match. But Coventry are comfortable with that.</p><p>The Sky Blues side are counter-attacking specialists and have should enjoy the late late chaos that so often accompanies these matches.</p><p>Coventry have also never lost an EFL play-off match before (W3 D2), winning their only previous final 3-1 against Exeter in 2017-18.</p><p>Meanwhile, Luton have suffered five defeats across their seven Wembley appearances, and that’s not to mention their 100 per cent losing record from two previous play-off finals in the National League.</p><h2>Feisty…</h2><p>The pair received their fair share of cautions during the campaign. Luton ended with 85 cards, while Coventry finished with 90.</p><p>With a tight affair expected, this could be a very stop-start clash with lots of tactical challenges and cynical fouls. Evidence of that was seen in Middlesbrough vs Coventry, which yielded 10 bookings in 90 minutes. 11 were shown over the two legs in Luton's semi-final.</p><p>Michael Oliver will officiate on Saturday, and he's dished out 159 cards in 45 matches this year with 6+ awarded in seven of those.</p><h2>Coventry vs Luton odds</h2><p>Odds are correct at the time of publication and are subject to change.</p><h2 id=remember-to-gamble-responsibly>Remember to gamble responsibly</h2><p><strong>A responsible gambler is someone who:</strong></p><ul><li>Establishes time and monetary limits before playing</li><li>Only gambles with money they can afford to lose</li><li>Never chase their losses</li><li>Doesn’t gamble if they’re upset, angry or depressed</li><li>Gamcare –&nbsp;<a href=#>www.gamcare.org.uk</a></li><li>Gamble Aware –&nbsp;<a href=#>www.begambleaware.org</a></li></ul><p>For help with a gambling problem, call the National Gambling Helpline on 0808 8020 133 or go to www.gamstop.co.uk to be excluded from all UK-regulated gambling websites.</p><p>*18+.
