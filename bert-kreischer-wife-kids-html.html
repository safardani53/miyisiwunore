The father-of-two once <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">took a Fatherly Questionnaire</a> where he candidly talked about his relationship with his daughters.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The answers&nbsp;were&nbsp;from 2018, and Bert's daughters, Georgia and Ila, were 13&nbsp;and 11&nbsp;years respectively,&nbsp;back then, which makes them 16 and 14 years of age as of this writing.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Bert Kreischer Doesn't Consider Himself a Great Father</h2><p>The stand-up <a href=# rel=follow>comedian</a> picked out three words that best described him as a father: selfish, mediocre, and loving. He also admitted that there were fathers out there who "kill it," but he wasn't one of those people.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>He relied strongly on his sense of humor, his childish energy, and his empathy to raise his daughters the best he could, and in doing so, he has his ways of expressing how much he adores them.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>For instance, his favorite father-daughter activity to share with his younger daughter is letting her bully him into doing silly things like jumping into a pool or eating a dozen donuts in one go. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"I love that crazy complex bully energy about her," he added.&nbsp;</p><p>As for his favorite pass time with his eldest, he revealed&nbsp;he loved going for a 6 a.m. walk with just Georgia whenever they were out for a vacation.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Bert Kreischer's Way of Showing Love to His Kids</h2><p>While the stand-up comedian makes&nbsp;it a point to scream "I LOVE YOU" at the top of his lungs every time he drops&nbsp;his daughters at school, he also has&nbsp;a few subtler ways of letting his kids know he loved them.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The first one on the list was to give them four kisses on their cheeks. He also admitted that although his daughters didn't know it, he always booked the earliest flight he could find to get back home. He explained,&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Even if I have three shows on Sunday and get done at 3 a.m., I take the 6 a.m. flight back home.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Bert Kreischer Has Some Regrets</h2><p>However, despite his subtler ways, there are some decisions&nbsp;he has&nbsp;made in favor of his career, that as a father, he would regret to the day he goes six feet under.&nbsp;</p><p>He admitted that the biggest regret that he has&nbsp;as a father was signing up for the Travel Channel show&nbsp;Bert The Adventurer, for which he had to spend seven years away from his family.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"I don’t regret the job or working for the channel," he expounded,&nbsp;"I regret being away from home. On my grave, I will regret that."</p><p>Ironically, the television personality committed to the&nbsp;act he regretted the most because he loved his family. Admittedly, at that time, he was afraid that his career wouldn't work out. So, he thought that if he took up that job, he could put a roof over their heads.</p><p>Sadly, in doing so, he missed out on some of the most important years with his kids.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJqVp8Fut9GeoKybmJq%2FbsPIn5xmo5mZwG%2B006aj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aracely-arambulas-boyfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Aracely Arambula Dating Aracely Arambula's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
