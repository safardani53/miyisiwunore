Some of these early seasons have fans’ favourite episodes, so don’t miss a minute.</p><ul><li><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline><strong>OMG:</strong></span></a> How did Scott Disick’s parents die?</li></ul><h3>Best KUWTK episodes to watch on Netflix</h3><ul><li>Kim Becomes a Diva – season 2, episode 1</li><li>You’re So Pregnant Dude – season 1, episode 6</li><li>Kris the Cheerleader – season 2, episode 4</li><li>Kim’s Calendar for Reggie – season 2, episode 9</li><li>Helping Hand – season 1, episode 7</li><li>Kardashian Family Vacation – season 2, episode 8</li><li>Kardashian Civil War – season 2, episode 7</li><li>A New Perspective in New Orleans – season 2, episode 10</li><li>Brody in the House – season 1, episode 3</li><li>Remembering Dad – season 1, episode 5</li></ul><h3>Will other seasons of KUWTK come to Netflix?</h3><p>Unconfirmed, but likely. We will keep this page updated with any new information about when the other series will be released to Netflix.</p><p>It is likely, given that the series is still airing on E! that they will stagger the release. It has been over a decade since these seasons aired, so finally having them on Netflix is a blessing for fans.</p><p>One fan tweeted: “petition to put the rest of the seasons of kuwtk on netflix cause i’ve binged nearly both in one day”</p><p>Another wrote: “<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">I see </span><span class=r-18u37iz>#KUWTK</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> is on Netflix too but only two seasons?
