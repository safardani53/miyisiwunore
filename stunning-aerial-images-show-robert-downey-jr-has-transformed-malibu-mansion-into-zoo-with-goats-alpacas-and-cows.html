fascinating glimpse into his animal kingdom with white goats and alpacas grazing blissfully in the sunshine at the end of his garden.</p><p>The giant estate also includes fenced pastures, several riding rings and 12 rose-covered horse stalls for his family’s beloved animals.</p><p>According to reports, Downey lives with dozens of other pets, including pigs, cows, pygmy goats, a larger rescue goat named Cutie Boots, chickens and two cats named Montgomery and D’Artagnan.</p><p>His spacious compound consists of two main properties – each of which contrast dramatically in style and design – where he spends the majority of his time with his wife of 14 years, Susan Downey, and their two children: son, Exton, 7, and daughter Avri, 5.</p><img

first property, believed to be the family’s main residence, is a cozy ranch-style two-story home, situated at the end of a picturesque tree-lined driveway, with three bedrooms and four bathrooms — formerly owned by actor Mark Harmon’s sister, Kelly.</p><p>She reportedly introduced bleached oak floors and antique limestone fireplaces in a huge revamp before selling the property to Downey, complete with a barn converted into a two-bedroom guesthouse and multiplex court for basketball and tennis.</p><p>The second parcel of land features a newly built white space age-style dwelling with dome-like windows and doors leading out to the pool area — a dramatic one-story living unit which could rival Iron Man’s abode in The Avengers.</p><p>Succulent plants, trees and manicured bushes surround the futuristic building.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

pathway made of stone pavers, with an elephant, flamingo and penguin among those close to a giant pool area, which boasts a hot tub and outdoor seating with sun-loungers.</p><p>Downey’s multi-million-dollar car collection, rumored to include an Audi R8 and Nissan GTR, is just like his lead character Tony Stark’s with more than 20 vehicles seen parked around the actor’s lavish property.</p><p>Four of his flash cars are seen protected under grey waterproof covers next to a large silver airstream caravan and multiple garages, some made up of giant shipping containers covered in vines and plants.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

style, with at least 14 electric and pedal-powered vehicles parked on the multi play court, including two high-end electric golf carts with leather seats.</p><p>When they’re not driving around on an ATV, they can also make the most of a swing-set, climbing frames and a trampoline on the site, while toys are also seen scattered about on the lawns.</p><p>Another standout feature at Downey’s abode is a metal, multi-colored installation of three dancing figures in the middle of a lawn by artist Keith Haring, believed to be worth more than $300,000.</p><p>The green-fingered actor also grows his own produce in a herb and vegetable patch planted in raised beds in the garden.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

And my missus [Susan, who is a producer on the film] is like, 'This is good.'</p><p>“And I basically live on a rescue farm, and I look out and the alpacas are looking at me, and I'm like, 'All right!'
