Jeanick was a previous winner of Canada’s Got Talent.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Jeanick won the second season of Canada’s Got Talent, which premiered in March 2022.&nbsp;She auditioned for the show with a stunning rendition of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Celine Dion’s</strong></a> “I Surrender” and got the Golden Buzzer from host <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lindsay Ell</strong></a>.</p><h2>2. Jeanick works in the medical field.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Jeanick has spent years working as a palliative care worker.&nbsp;“I like taking care of people,” Jeanick told the Montreal Gazette. “The thing that ties the two jobs together is that they’re both about giving, about sharing. On the one hand, I hear confessions from people who’re at the very end of their lives. As an attendant, I give people baths and people at the end of their lives, they’re not there to tell lies. They’re in full truth mode. Often they confide in us, maybe more than with their family because they don’t want to hurt people in their family.”</p><h2>3. Jeanick has two kids.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Jeanick is the mother to two adopted special needs children:<strong> Yohan</strong> and <strong>Emma</strong>. They both have Down syndrome. “They have so much love in their heart, and they help me to stay in the moment,” Jeanick gushed in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her audition video</a> for Canada’s Got Talent.</p><h2>4.

Jeanick is known for her Celine Dion tribute show.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Celine has always been a musical influence. Jeanick frequently performs Celine’s songs. The two singers met at a concert at the Centre Vidéotron. “I always admired her as a woman,” Jeanick told the Montreal Gazette. “She has an extraordinary discipline when it comes to work. She’s a real performer. Then there’s the human side, her focus on the family. That always really touched me, as did the way she sings. She’s an inspiration.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K3pq3NopqkZZakwrO6yJ6pZmxpboRyg5Fo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./when-does-madden-mobile-23-come-out.html><span>←</span><span>'Madden Mobile 23' Has a Different Release Date Than 'Madden 23'</span></a>
