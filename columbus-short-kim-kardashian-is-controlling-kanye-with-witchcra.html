No, this is not an early Halloween prank.</p><p>“This,” Columbus claims. “Is what it looks like.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>We guess that about half the students in any early morning math class anyone’s ever taken are also under the thrall of witches, then.</p><p>“Its [sic] a unaddressed issue but real and present right now,” Columbus continues.</p><p>He goes on to claim that: “Both men and women all over the WORLD are unknowingly being tormented by witchcraft.”</p><p>“And this,” he says. “Is what it looks like.”</p><p>“You can call me crazy,” he very correctly states. “But I suggest you guys do your research.”</p><p>Obviously, no amount of actual research is going to validate his claims.</p><p>There are plenty of people whose personal spiritual practices can be described as witchcraft.</p><p>They come from a number of faiths or may not subscribe to any religion.</p><p>But they are very much not mind-controlling anyone, least of all Kanye West.</p><p>Some might say that a little mind-control would do Kanye some good right about now.</p><p>Easily the best thing about Columbus’ witchcraft theory is the replies.</p><p>Sure, some of them are people agreeing with him and warning that they fear for his life since he’s “exposing” this “truth.”</p><p>One person tweeted: “You Already Know What’s going on in The Devil Illuminati Industry,” which is one hell of a sentence.</p><p>Others are arguing with him … saying that it’s not witchcraft mind-control, but MK Ultra mind-control.</p><p>Social media is amazing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>This is a little like when Flat Earth “Theorists” start espousing their views, only to get arguments from Hollow Earth theorists.</p><p>To the rest of us, one theory seems about the same as the other.</p><p>But that’s because two concepts, each equally divorced from reality, seem equally absurd.</p><p>To those who really believe them, however, it makes all of the difference in the world.</p><p>It seems that Columbus really, truly believes that Kim has hexxed Kanye.</p><p>On a more serious note, Columbus referring to “torment” by “witchcraft” brings to mind his arrest warrant from just last month.</p><p>The warrant was issued in September after he failed to appear in court for a divorce proceeding.</p><p>His divorce from&nbsp;Tuere Tanee Short began all the way back in 2014, around the time of his <a href=#>arrest for domestic violence</a>.</p><p>She filed for divorce after he threatened to kill her and himself, and she was granted a temporary restraining order at the time.</p><p>He has also been accused of other acts of violence, including violence against another woman’s child and threatening to kill Jamie Foxx for some reason.</p><p>It is unclear if he believes that his life setbacks are the results of sabotage by witchcraft. They are clearly his own fault.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Kanye’s behavior has been worrisome to a lot of his fans, and people seem desperate for an explanation.</p><p>Some think that Kim is just not good for him.</p><p>Others choose to blame mental illness, as if there aren’t millions of people with mental illness who manage to not be terrible.</p><p>Now, an accused domestic abuser thinks that Kanye is under a witch’s mind-control.</p><p>When, we wonder, are people going to stop making excuses that turn Kanye into the victim.</p><p>Maybe Kanye West is just … bad. And maybe he has been bad all along, and people can no longer find easy excuses to ignore it.</p><a href=#><img width=2560 height=1624 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/kanye-with-trump-scaled.jpg alt="Kanye with Trump" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>14 Things Kanye West Actually Said in His Meeting with Donald Trump</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2Z9cK%2FOpaymmqWoerS0zqurZqOZonqsrdGdmKygmZa7brXSZpqopqSnvK24yKeeZqORo8amedaiq6Flp57BpLTCq5ho</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./covered-blisters-touching-britains-most-dangerous-plant.html><span>←</span><span>I was left covered in blisters the size of GOLF BALLS after touching Britain's 'most dangerous plant</span></a>
