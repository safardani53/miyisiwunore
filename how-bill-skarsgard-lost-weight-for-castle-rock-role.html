You get into ketogenesis and you just eat a lot of fat and no carbs. I lose weight quickly. Before scenes, I would not drink water or eat for 24 hours. It does a lot … It changes your face. I think it played real well into the role. It gave off this boney, skeletal look.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bill-Skarsgard.jpg><p>He also noted that during filming, he did have cheat days – and there was one meal he couldn’t wait to have after they wrapped.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We shot a scene in the shower at block five. Even though it was episode one, we shot while shooting episode five so I’m like, ‘Well f–k, I need to stay skinny all the way up to the point,'” Skarsgard explained. “I didn’t eat for 24 hours. The day before, 24 hours before that, I had like, a salad and didn’t drink any water. So I was f–king skinny and parched. Then after that day of shooting, I wanted a beer and burger. I didn’t drink for three months, either, so I went to a shady dive bar and it was great.”</p><p>Castle Rock premieres on Hulu Wednesday, July 25.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ%2Bor12Xtq24jKyimqqjnK6zsIylpqysXayyqrPHrWSfp6JisKK%2F06WcZqqfmLhuvs6lnGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./years-movie-actress-julia-stiles-career-achievement-net-worth-she-has-managed.html><span>←</span><span>American Actress Julia Stiles' Career &amp;amp; Struggles as an Actress: Her Achievement and Net Worth</span></a>
