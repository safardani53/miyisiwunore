Over the course of his career, the actor has maintained a fairly low-key while bringing some of the most memorable characters of the big screen to life. The actor became a dad for the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>seventh time</a> in April 2023. He had a daughter, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gia Virginia Chen-De Niro</strong></a>, with his girlfriend,<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;<strong>Tiffany Chen</strong></a>. Over two months later, Robert’s eldest daughter&nbsp;<strong>Drena De Niro&nbsp;</strong>announced that her son <strong>Leandro De Niro Rodriguez</strong>, 19, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>had died</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Although De Niro rarely discusses his personal life publicly, there are some interesting facts to learn about his family, previous relationships and marriages, and his seven children. Learn more about the actor’s personal life with the comprehensive timeline below, including his newborn!</p><h2>Drena De Niro</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>De Niro marred&nbsp;<strong>Diahnne Abbot</strong> in 1976, and subsequently became the stepfather to Diahnne’s daughter from a previous marriage,&nbsp;<strong>Drena</strong>. Diahnne and De Niro met on the set of the 1976 film Taxi Driver, which starred De Niro in one of his most iconic roles. Drena, born September 3, 1971, took her stepfather’s last name and went on to follow in both of her parents’ footsteps.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Robert-De-Niro-Kids-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Drena is an actress and model. Her transition to acting began in her mid-20s, when she played a receptionist in the film&nbsp;Grace of My Heart. Over the course of a few decades, Drena built up a strong filmography with a number of credits, including a role in 2018’s Oscar-nominated film&nbsp;A Star Is Born, starring <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Lady Gaga</a>&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Bradley Cooper</strong></a>, as well as a role in the film&nbsp;Joy, co-starring her stepfather and starring&nbsp;<strong>Jennifer Lawrence</strong>. Drena is close with both her mom and stepfather, and often shares a photo or two with De Niro on her Instagram page.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>On July 2, Drena <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announced</a> the death of her 19-year-old son, and Robert’s grandson, <strong>Leandro De Niro Rodriguez</strong>. Drena shared Leandro with New York-based artist <strong>Carlos Mare</strong>. Leo had a small part in A Star Is Born with his mom. “My beautiful sweet angel. I have loved you beyond words or description from the moment I felt you in my belly,” Drena wrote in her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>emotional message</a> on Instagram. “You have been my joy my heart and all that was ever pure and real in my life. I wish I was with you right now. I wish I was with you. I don’t know how to live without you but I’ll try to go on and spread the love and light that you so made me feel in getting to be your mama.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Drena continued, “You were so deeply loved and appreciated and I wish that love alone could have saved you. I’m so sorry my baby. I’m so sorry @carlosmare. Rest in Peace and Eternal Paradise my darling boy.” Robert has not commented on his grandson’s passing yet.</p><h2>Raphael De Niro</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Robert-De-Niro-Kids-embed-3.jpg><strong>Raphael De Niro</strong> is the first child between&nbsp;Diahnne Abbot and Robert De Niro. The couple welcomed their son on November 9, 1976. Much like his half-sister, Drena, Raphael also started his career in acting. Early on, Raphael appeared in films alongside his father, including&nbsp;Awakenings and&nbsp;Raging Bull. Although he started out in acting, Raphael made a pretty drastic career change as an adult.<p id=content-paragraph-9>Raphael went on to become a real estate broker, founding the firm De Niro Team, Douglas Elliman, described as a “real estate advisory team with 15 years of proven success in New York City resale and new development,” per their <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram page</a>. Of his clients, Raphael has worked with the likes of <strong>Jon Bon Jovi</strong>, <strong>Kelly Ripa</strong>, and more when it comes to their real estate pursuits. Raphael has been married twice and has three children with his ex-wife <strong>Claudine De Mato</strong>.&nbsp;When Raphael was just a pre-teen, his father and mother filed for divorce.</p><h2>Julian & Aaron De Niro</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Following his divorce from Diahnne Abbot, De Niro started dating model&nbsp;<strong>Toukie Smith</strong>. During their relationship, which lasted from 1988 to 1996, De Niro and Toukie welcomed twin sons, <strong>Julian</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Aaron De Niro</strong>. The twin boys were conceived via in vitro fertilization, and born via surrogate in October 1995. Both Julian and Aaron are fairly private about their lives. Although they did attend red carpet events with their father and mother as youngsters, as adults they lead relatively quiet lives.</p><h2>Elliot De Niro</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>By 1997, De Niro married his second wife, <strong>Grace Hightower</strong>. The couple welcomed their son, <strong>Elliot De Niro</strong>, in 1998. Elliot is a young person with special needs, and Grace and her husband were adamant about finding their son an outlet to enjoy and be himself. They enrolled Elliot in tennis lessons and he fell in love with the sport.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“He wasn’t crazy about it, at times,” De Niro confessed of his son’s enthusiasm for tennis in a video for <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ESPN</a>. “His mother was good at pushing [him], and wanting him to be physical and work out,” De Niro went on. “He has realized, ‘Oh, I can accomplish this,'” Grace said of her son. “It has helped him socially,” she went on. “It helps him be more confident when he sees that he’s actually good at this,” De Niro said of his son’s relationship with tennis and exercising. “That’s the best self-motivator one can have. He’s gonna feel better about himself, which he does. So, it’s a win-win for everybody, especially [Elliot].”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Heavy</a>, Robert revealed back in 2016 that Elliot is on the autism spectrum. He had just yanked the controversial film Vaxxed from the Tribeca Film Festival, stating that the controversial anti-vaccine film is something “everyone should see.” According to Heavy, De Niro claims via The <a href=# rel="noopener external nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Telegraph </a>that Elliot “changed overnight” after having a measles vaccination administered.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>While it’s clear that De Niro had Grace have a strong bond and support for their son, the couple nearly split less than three years after getting married. They initially called it quits on their marriage in 1999, but the divorce was never finalized. In 2004, De Niro and Hightower renewed their vows.</p><h2>Helen De Niro</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>With their marriage back on track, De Niro and his wife made the decision to expand their family further. In 2011, the couple welcomed their daughter, <strong>Helen De Niro</strong>, via surrogate. Little is known about Helen, after all she is nearly 10 years old. But years after she was welcomed into the De Niro family, Helen’s parents officially made the decision to end their marriage. Grace and De Niro separated in 2018, and their divorce is very much still up in the air due to ongoing legal issues and more.</p><h2>Gia Virginia Chen-De Niro</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Robert De Niro and his partner Tiffany Chen welcomed Gia Virginia Chen-De Niro in early April — and now, she’s making her national TV debut on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#CBSMornings</a>. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>https://t.co/OJJxGcEKlU</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/opiFRpWkRs</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-16>— CBS Mornings (@CBSMornings) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>May 11, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-18>The&nbsp;Goodfellas&nbsp;actor was revealed to have <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed a seventh child</a> in an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ET Canada</a> on May 9, 2023. “Seven, actually. I just had a baby,” he said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>Robert let&nbsp;CBS Mornings anchor <strong>Gayle King&nbsp;</strong>reveal details about his new baby on May 11. Gayle <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>showed the first picture</a> of Robert and Tiffany’s <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>newborn daughter,</a> named Gia Virginia Chen-De Niro. Gayle revealed that baby Gia was born April 6 and weighed 8 pounds, 6 ounces. She said Robert and Tiffany “are over the moon” about their new baby.</p><h2>What Robert De Niro Has Said About His Children</h2><p id=content-paragraph-20>Throughout his career, De Niro has rarely discussed his personal life. But during a June 2020 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, the actor welcomed the opportunity to talk about his children and raising them over the course of the last few decades. “My children are all half Black and I don’t have, even me, I take certain things for granted,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the actor admitted</a> to eponymous host,&nbsp;<strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>“When people say that they tell their kids, ‘Keep your hands [out] when you’re stopped by any cops, keep your hands on the steering wheel, don’t make a sudden move, don’t put your hands below, don’t do this,’ you understand that,” he continued, adding, “That’s scary. That has to change.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>Along with revealing such details about watching his children navigate the world, he’s also been quite candid about how he feels when it comes to them following in his footsteps and pursuing a career in acting. “For my kids, I tell them, ‘If you want to be an actor or you want to do this or that, that’s fine as long as you’re happy,’” the actor told People. “Just don’t sell yourself short. That’s the most I would say — push yourself a little more and reach for what you really think it is you want to do. Don’t be afraid.” He was very adamant that he wanted this kids to “find their own lane.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>While he has been very reticent to discuss his children in the past, De Niro appears to be very supportive and love them very much — like any other involved parent. “I love my children, just being with them,” the actor <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gushed to&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;April 2019</a>. “It’s not easy. Sometimes it’s fun and you love your kids, and sometimes you want to kill them!” Like any parent, it’s clear that Robert De Niro’s relationships with his children have been totally unique, but also familiar for his longtime fans who might be parents, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9GomZ6qpGKxpnnNoqmoZZuesbR5k21ob29maXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./was-rapper-fetty-wap-arrested-new-jersey.html><span>←</span><span>Why was Fetty Wap arrested?</span></a>
