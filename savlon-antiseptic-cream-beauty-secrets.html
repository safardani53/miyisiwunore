Her 16-year-old daughter Ellie is so impressed, she has even started doing it, too.</p><p>Michelle, who is also mum to Owen, 14, and Alfie, 11, says: “When Ellie and I are out together <a href=#>people assume we’re sisters</a> or best friends. When I’m with all three kids, people treat me like a fourth sibling and ask us where our mum is.</p><p>“When I reveal I’M their parent, they’re so shocked. I’ve even had sales people knock on the front door and ask if my parents are in.</p><p>“When I explain I’m the parent they’re so embarrassed.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000420874882.jpg><p>Michelle from Dagenham, Essex, insists her <a href=#>youthful looks are natural</a>.</p><p>She says: “My only secret is Savlon. I use it every morning before applying my foundation and every evening after I shower.</p><p>“I started using it when I was 25 because I knew the cream’s antiseptic properties would stop spots. It worked so well I wouldn’t use anything else. Even Ellie uses it now.</p><p>“My mum Denise looks young despite being in her sixties, so I definitely take after her. Good skin is in my genes.”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">'Too much may irritate skin'</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>DR DARON Seukeran, Group Medical Director at Sk:n clinic, says: “It’s likely that the Savlon cream is hydrating Sharon’s skin and potentially making it look younger. There isn’t any magic ingredient in it acting as a rejuvenating agent.</p><p>“Savlon cream should be used as an antiseptic to help heal minor disorders such as cuts and blisters. If applied too frequently, it could cause an irritant effect.</p><p>“Using a face moisturiser daily can also keep skin plump and radiant, lessening the appearance of wrinkles.” Visit skinclinics.co.uk .</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>I had a full face of Love Island style fillers done aged only 21.. and here's what it looks like</span><p>Michelle and Ellie also feel more like sisters than mum and daughter — often borrowing each other’s clothes and taking selfies together.</p><p>Michelle says: “We argue like sisters, especially about clothes. I always catch Ellie stealing my dresses and skirts. But we’re also best friends, and Ellie feels comfortable sharing anything with me.</p><p>“I can’t wait until she turns 18 as we’ll be able to <a href=#>go clubbing together</a>. She takes pictures of me all the time and puts them on social media to show them off to her friends. People will tell her there’s no way I’m her mum. Some have even said we look like twins.</p><p>“She’s always taking Snapchat selfies with me, just like she does with her friends. Although I have to act like her mum, I also feel like one of the girls.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000420874737.jpg><p>Michelle adds: “Recently, I took Ellie prom-dress shopping. When I saw her in her dress looking like a princess I got so emotional.</p><p>“I said to the saleswoman, ‘I can’t believe how much my little girl has grown up’.</p><p>“‘Wait, are you her mum? I thought you were her sister,’ she replied, stunned. It is really flattering.</p><p>“Once, I put a picture of us on Facebook and I got hundreds of comments asking who was who. We just laugh it off.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000420874491.jpg><p>But there is a downside to looking so young.</p><p>Michelle, who is a petite 5ft 2in, says: “I have to wear high heels at parents’ evenings so I’m not mistaken for a student. And <a href=#>I have to carry ID</a> as shop assistants refuse to serve me without it. The look on their faces is priceless when they find out my age.”</p><p>Michelle, who has been with partner Kevin Overton, 34, a lorry driver and removal man for four years, believes Savlon is her skin’s saviour. She says: “Even juggling two jobs and being a mum to three children hasn’t made the stress or wrinkles show.</p><p>“One day I’ll grow old gracefully, but for now I’m happy to be mistaken for a teenager. When I’m 60 I hope I still look half my age and look 30. It’s the best compliment, and luckily I won’t have to splash out on any cosmetic surgery.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425303096-e1533750424870.jpg><p>Ellie adds: “I love having a young-looking mum. We spend loads of time together and it feels like we’re friends. It’s so funny to see people’s faces when I tell them she’s my mum. They don’t believe me and she gets so much attention.</p><p>“People always think we’re best friends, especially when we’re clothes shopping.</p><p>“We have a really close bond. I can’t wait to go clubbing with her when I turn 18.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in fabulous</h2></p><p>“No one in the club will guess I’m out with my mum.</p><p>“Her looking so young gives us the chance to have a different kind of relationship than some of my friends do with their mums.</p><p>“I hope I look so young when I’m Mum’s age. I’m using Savlon cream every chance I get now.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5VybmtraWp8tK3VpaanZZGjwaq%2FxKmroptdmL%2BmrcxmmZ6ZpanGbr%2FEnKmerKNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joshua-jackson-and-jodie-turner-smiths-relationship-timeline.html><span>←</span><span>Joshua Jackson and Jodie Turner-Smith's Relationship Timeline</span></a>
