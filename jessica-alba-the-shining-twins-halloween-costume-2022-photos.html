According to a source who attended the event, which was sponsored by Aquahydrate, “Jessica <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>looked absolutely stunning</a>, even as one of the scariest fictional characters ever.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/jessica-alba-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>The party, which was thrown by the founder of Kombucha <strong>GT Dave</strong> and his husband <strong>Allen Fanucchi</strong>, was attended by over 100 people and it was “very elite” the insider told us. “Jessica was not shy about talking to other guests who were coming up to her and asking for their picture with her.” Although Jessica’s husband Cash, 43, and their three kids, <strong>Honor</strong>, 14, <strong>Haven</strong>, 11, and <strong>Hayes</strong>, 4, were not there, the source said that “she was talking about how wonderful her family is and also about <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her beautiful children</a>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/jessica-alba-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>“People were also coming up to her and telling her that they absolutely love some of the products they bought from <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Honest Company</a>,” the source revealed, referring to the safe baby and beauty products online store that she founded in 2011.&nbsp; But it wasn’t all business at the party, as the source told us, “Jessica was also dancing and having a ton of laughs. She really looked so relaxed and confident. She was so humble and she interacted with anyone who wanted to talk to her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/jessica-alba-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Needless to say, Jessica and her bestie nailed their costumes. The actress and Chener wore matching light blue baby doll dresses, with a pink ribbon tied around their waist. Their dresses had see-through ruffled shoulder pads and came to just above the knee. For her hairstyle, Jessica and Chener even replicated the look of The Shining twins. They both parted their hair to one side and had it clipped. However, according to the source inside the event, “She did not look scary at all, but I don’t think that she could ever really look frightening.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5FtZqOdo6i2pK2MmqObmV2ptaZ50qGgp6GenHq1w8inqmagkaG5sMPEnqVmm5%2Bowba5xGZpaWpiYr2pu9Ooqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jim-titus.html><span>←</span><span>Jim Titus- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Ethnicity</span></a>
