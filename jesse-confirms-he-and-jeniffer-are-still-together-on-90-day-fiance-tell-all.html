Jesse first appeared on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 2 with Darcey Silva, whereas Jeniffer appeared on season 3 with Tim Malcolm.</p><p>Fans caught onto the pair’s relationship after Jeniffer posted a PDA snap with a blonde man in June 2021. Die-hard 90 Day fans were quick to recognize Jesse and the pair confirmed their relationship shortly after.</p><p>But how did the couple cross paths? Well, as a lot of modern-day love stories, the relationship started on social media. When they appeared on season 2 of 90 Day Fiancé: The Single Life, Jeniffer revealed she wrote to Jesse who didn’t reply until a year later!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=jesses-appearance-on-the-tellall-causes-drama>Jesse’s appearance on the tell-all causes drama</h2><p>Jesse joined the tell-all via zoom from Spain and told the rest of the cast Jeniffer couldn’t be there as she was on a flight.</p><p>On last season’s tell-all, the couple had a confrontation with Tim and Veronica and it seems this season Jesse was back for more. Jesse wasn’t holding back with his opinions, criticizing Tim and Veronica for still being close as exes.</p><p>However, this time, it wasn’t Tim and Veronica grilling Jesse. It was in fact the rest of the cast who were convinced him and Jeniffer had split up.</p><p>Jesse was quick to deny this though and showed the cast a video on his phone which Jeniffer had just sent to him. The rest of the cast, however, still were not convinced, so Jesse said he would call her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-don-t-understand-why-jesse-was-on-the-tell-all>Fans don’t understand why Jesse was on the tell-all</h2><p>Fans of the tell-all were confused as to why Jesse even made an appearance on this season’s tell-all. So of course, they took to Twitter to talk about this.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The real question here, is why is Jesse in the <a href=#>#tellall</a> <a href=#>#90DayFiance</a></p>— meeeeh♏️ (@alma49451161) <a href=#>December 13, 2022</a></figure>View Tweet<p>One <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fan</a> said: “Why is Jesse still being brought onto this show?!
