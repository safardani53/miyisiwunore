In 2005 the film was remade with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Johnny Depp</a> in the role of Willy Wonka. In 2016, the story got the Broadway treatment and was adapted for the stage with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Christian Borle</a> starring as the chocolatier, and in 2023, fans will see Chalamet don the iconic top hat and purple coat in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Wonka</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Obviously, he's walking in the footsteps of some truly phenomenal performers who played the role before, so the bar was set very high," Wonka director Paul King <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>recently told PEOPLE</a> of Chalamet. "I think what's so remarkable about his performance is not only that he is funny and mischievous and quite mysterious, as well — just like the Willy Wonka that people will know — but also, he brings such heart to the role and he's a brilliant actor."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He's incredibly emotionally intelligent and can bring a great deal of emotional truth to the role," King added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From Wilder to Chalamet here's a closer look at all of the Willy Wonka actors throughout the years.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-timothe-chalamet></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Timothée Chalamet</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Timothée Chalamet as Willy Wonka.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Warner Bros; Stephane Cardinale/Corbis via Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chalamet, 27, steps into the eccentric chocolate-maker's shoes in Wonka, which is set to hit theaters on December 15, 2023.

"Depp, an actor of considerable gifts, has never been afraid to take a chance, but this time he takes the wrong one. His Willy Wonka is an enigma in an otherwise mostly delightful movie from&nbsp;Tim Burton, where the visual invention is a wonderment."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This film also had musical numbers, composed by Danny Elfman, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>who told Entertainment Weekly</a> he was not tied to the nostalgia from the first film.
