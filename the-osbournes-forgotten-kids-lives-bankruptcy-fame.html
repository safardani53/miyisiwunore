No."</p><p>While Aimee shunned the show, she still went on to follow in her father's footsteps with hopes of becoming a musician.</p><p>In 2010, she began recording and releasing music - a far cry from her dad's heavy metal background - with her band ARO.</p><p>The band went quiet in 2016, and didn't release another single until 2020 when Shared Something With the Night was written.</p><p>Aimee has performed all over the world with the band, and compares the live experiences as like being "at Disneyland".</p><h4>Jessica Starshine Osbourne</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000644810695.jpg><p>Jessica is Ozzy Osbourne's eldest daughter - who he shares with his former wife Thelma - and was born in Grimsby in 1972.</p><p>While she didn't feature in The Osbournes, she was mentioned in passing in one episode which shocked viewers at the time.</p><p>In the episode - Smells Like Teen Spirit - Ozzy recieved the news that Jessica had given birth to a baby girl, making him a grandfather for the first time.</p><p>Mum-of-three Jessica, 49, has managed to keep most of her life away from the spotlight despite working in costume and wardrobe for films.</p><p>She's also been a makeup designer in Hollywood as well as a writer and director of her own films - including short film Yellowville.</p><p>She went on to star in film Phone Friends and Between Both in 2006, and You Better Call Saul more recently in 2015.</p><p>Despite rumours often circulating that Jessica has been in a long-term relationship for over a decade, she has never given away any details.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h4>Louis Osbourne</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000685544221.jpg><p>Ozzy's son Louis from his first marriage is rarely in the spotlight, but he did appear in the first series of the MTV show.</p><p>Born in Birmingham in 1975 - the DJ featured in The Osbournes' Christmas special episode as well as episodes Puss and Get Stuffed.</p><p>Louis already worked as a DJ in the 90s in Ibiza and across America before his TV fame, but found himself in trouble later on in life.</p><p>Louis ended up facing financial problems and filed for bankruptcy - leaving him with none of the fortune he had amounted from his career.</p><p>He now lives in a modest £250,000 house with his actress wife Louise, and enjoys a quiet family life, away from the rest of the Osbourne clan.</p><p>Louis once said of his broken family dynamic: "I don’t travel half as much as I used to and they are in America. "</p><p>"There is more chance of us seeing each other in a random New York hotel than us all getting round a table for a Sunday lunch. We meet on special occasions.</p><p>He added: "Dad usually calls on a Sunday afternoon for a catch up and when he comes over to the UK we take the kids down (to his home in Buckinghamshire). Dad is great, very much a doting grandad."</p><h4>Elliot Kingsley</h4><p>Elliot is not a blood relative to the Osbourne clan - but he was adopted by Ozzy from his previous marriage to Thelma Mayfair.</p><p>Ozzy and Thelma met as his group Black Sabbath were taking off, and they were married shortly after in 1971.</p><p>But Thelma already had Elliot, then five, from a previous marriage - and Ozzy opted to adopt the young boy as his own.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Elliot never featured on the MTV show and was rarely mentioned throughout the series - keeping his life private.</p><p>Currently, he is said to be working as an actor and has a net worth, according to Washington Independent, of around $600,000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000600371694.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Sharon Osbourne's husband Ozzy defends host and says she's 'the most unracist person ever' after she quit The Talk</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hraGeAdX%2BWaKuhnV2kwKO71Kulnqtdm7yzs86tq56mXaC2pb%2BMpaCvnaNir6K6yqusqayTrnqnrcyeZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./billy-hayes-3.html><span>←</span><span>Billy Hayes (writer)</span></a>
