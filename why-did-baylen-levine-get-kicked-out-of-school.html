Although the latter can be a difficult subject to discuss, Baylen previously shared why he was given the boot in a candid video.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Baylen get kicked out of high school?</h2><p>When Baylen first started his YouTube channel, he was a senior in high school. For a few months, the channel saw nothing but success. But soon enough, his school found out about it, and let's just say that the administration wasn't the channel's biggest fan.</p><p>In 2018, Baylen shared what went down in a video aptly named "why i had to leave my high school."</p><p>He explained that in March of his senior year, he was called into the principal's office after his friend was caught handing out business cards advertising the channel that featured a photo of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate Upton</a> in a bathing suit. Baylen was told to make sure those cards were never brought to school again.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Aware that Baylen was a video creator, the principal also reminded him that he is to never film on school property or film while wearing any attire affiliated with the school, which the then-teenager understood.</p><p>Baylen also noted that during that conversation, he checked with the principal to see if he had any issues with the videos being made for the channel. "I literally remember double-checking," Baylen recalled, saying that the principal told him the channel was fine.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>That's why Baylen was so confused when an unspecified amount of time later, he was called into the office where the principal told him that he was being kicked out, but could withdraw first if he wanted to. At fault were Baylen's videos.</p><p>In one of the videos that raised concerns, Baylen and his friends pranked the employees at Moe's Southwest Grill. The principal claimed that they were being offensive toward Hispanics.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The principal also felt that another one of his videos which involved a massage business was racist. The contents of that video are unclear as it no longer appears to be on Baylen's channel.</p><p>Furthermore, some of Baylen's friends who had been involved were forced to go to disciplinary court as punishment.</p><p>In Baylen's video, he mentioned switching schools to finish off his senior year, but it's unclear if that actually happened. A graduate or not, it seems that Baylen has done pretty well for himself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aaka65prqMpZyvoZ6aeqix02aiopubmrFuu9StZKieXaiwqbvOpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tichina-arnolds-boyfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Tichina Arnold Dating Tichina Arnold's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
