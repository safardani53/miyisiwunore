So when we found this £69 cream knit jumper that looks just like a designer version worth £370, we couldn't wait to get our hands on it.
Both styles are crew neck, with eyelet stitching and bell-shaped sleeves.
The versatile jumpers are soft cream in colour and can be teamed with pretty much anything."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
