Thank you for your service," she added in the caption.</p><p>In just a few days the video got over 30 million views as people flocked to the comments to help identify the mystery man.</p><p>The celeb was soon identified as<strong> </strong>Mexican actor and director Eugenio González Derbez.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Showbiz</h2></p><p>The star has appeared in a number of movies including Overboard, The Valet, Dora and The Lost City Of Gold.</p><p>Although Craig went viral for the video, she revealed to&nbsp;<a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider</a>&nbsp;that she considered deleting it after she discovered who it was.</p><p>“I was contemplating taking it down since I had my answer, and then I wouldn’t have to risk the poor man finding out I did this when I had to sit next to him for five-ish more hours,” Craig said.</p><p>“I spent the rest of the five hours stressing that my video would pop up on his phone.”</p><p>Luckily for the influencer, he didn't show any hints that he saw the video while they were on the flight.</p><p>But by the next day, Derbez responded with a TikTok video of his own.</p><p>"Hi Paige, let me introduce myself. My name is&nbsp;Eugenio Derbez and I'm basically an actor and director."</p><p>After his introduction, the star shared a montage of his most iconic roles.</p><p>"Now, can someone tell me who this girl is?" he jokingly asked.
