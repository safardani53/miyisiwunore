Blige to get into the wine business. It actually started as a question to a friend: “What is the best Pinot Grigio in the world?” Her friend astutely pointed Mary to the Friuli-Venezia-Giulia region of Italy. Though you may not have heard of this region tucked into the mountains of Northeast Italy, it has grown in popularity thanks to an ideal microclimate providing a landscape that is extremely rich in minerals.</p><p>Mary was introduced to Marco Fantinel, a leading winemaker in the region. They formed a partnership to bring the art of Friulian wines to the world.</p><p><strong>Why the name Sun Goddess?</strong></p><p>According to Mary J. Blige, “The name Sun Goddess evokes powerful childhood memories that I carry with me today. I’ve always loved the sun, and as a child, I always tried to capture the sun’s warmth and energy. It was magical to me, and it’s with that spirit, that my mom began calling me ‘Sun Goddess.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_4294.jpg><p><strong>What’s the inspiration behind Sun Goddess?</strong></p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Specchio-edit-1.jpg alt="Sun Goddess" width=1000 height=1000 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span>“When creating&nbsp;</span><span><span class=sh-date>Sun</span></span><span> Goddess, it was very clear to me the barriers to entry for women and BIPOC leaders. Through partnering with GrapeStars, a company that shares my concerns of this accessibility gap, I’m able to share my own collection with more of my fans throughout the country, while making strides for the next generation of women and BIPOC winemakers.” – Mary J. Blige&nbsp;</span></p><p>Seemingly anything Mary J. Blige is involved with turns to gold (or in her case, platinum – as in worldwide record sales), which is why Sun Goddess is a must-try for anyone who is a fan of the classic Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc wines.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sauvignon-Blanc.jpg alt="Sun Goddess" width=700 height=700 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Buy Sun Goddess now on <a href=#>GrapeStars.com</a> or download the GrapeStars App, available on <a href=#>Apple</a> or <a href=#>Android</a> devices.</p><p>Enter the code MJBGS and receive free handling on any order and free 2-day shipping on orders of 6 bottles or more (total value of up to $30).
