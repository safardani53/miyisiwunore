I cook it over moderate heat. The tender, wild-caught tuna is already cooked and easy to add to any recipe, so I want to make sure I can warm it up and not overcook it so it retains its delicious flavor.”</p><p>Ray has shared dozens of mouth-watering Italian recipes over the years via her various cooking shows — including 30 Minute Meals, Rachael Ray’s Tasty Travels, Rachael Ray’s Week in a Day and $40 a Day — and over 20 New York Times bestselling cookbooks.</p><p>She has also become a staple of daytime TV with her self-titled talk show, which <a href=#>wrapped up its 17-season run</a> earlier this year. “In my more than 20 plus years in television I have had 17 wonderful seasons working in daytime television with Rachael,” she said of the show’s conclusion in a March statement to <a href=# rel=noopener>Deadline</a>. “However I’ve made the decision that it’s time for me to move on to the next exciting chapter in my broadcast career.”</p><p>Ray went on to note that her “passions have evolved from the talk show format production and syndication model to a platform unencumbered by the traditional rules of distribution” and that she would be launching her own production company, Free Food Studios. “Thank you to all of our Rachael daytime show partners, crew, and affiliates, and the wonderful years we all worked together,” her message concluded.</p><p>In addition to launching her new Hulu <a href=#>home renovation series</a>, Rachael Ray Rebuilds — which premieres on Monday, October 23 — Ray’s been busy sharing her latest Italian adventures with fans via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>.</p><p>“This Labor Day weekend was the first I didn’t labor at all in years! I’ve been working as hard and fast as I could since I was 12,” she captioned <a href=# rel=noopener>scenic pics of the ocean</a> on September 4. “@johnmcusimano and I truly had 4 wonderful days in Elba; it makes me cry how happy we have been here. I am so grateful to work hard, but what a gift to relax and breathe when we can.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to check out Ray’s Genova Yellowfin tuna and artichoke pasta recipe:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Rachael-Ray-shared-how-to-make-her-delicious-Geonva-Yellowfin-Tuna-3.jpg><h2>Genova Yellowfin Tuna and Artichoke Pasta</h2><p>SERVES 4</p><p>Ingredients</p><p>For Artichokes</p><ul><li>2 lemons</li><li>Artichokes (12 small/baby artichokes, if fresh; 2 cans artichoke hearts in water, if canned)</li><li>3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li><li>Salt and pepper (or red pepper)</li></ul><p>For Pasta</p><ul><li>2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li><li>4 tbsp butter, but into tabs</li><li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li><li>1 tsp crushed red pepper, optional</li><li>Salt</li><li>½ cup white wine (you may use chicken or vegetable stock)</li><li>1 lb spaghetti or linguine</li><li>2 cans (5 oz each) Genova Yellowfin Tuna in Olive Oil</li><li>Juice of 1 lemon</li><li>1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li><li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley, divided</li><li>A small handful of fresh mint, chopped and divide</li><li>¼ cup toasted pistachios, chopped (or pine nuts)</li></ul><p>Instructions</p><p>For Artichokes</p><p>1.
