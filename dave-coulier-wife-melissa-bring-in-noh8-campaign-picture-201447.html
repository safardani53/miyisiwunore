The NOH8 Campaign celebrated Full House alum <strong>Dave Coulier</strong>'s <a href=#>marriage</a> to his new wife <strong>Melissa Bring</strong> by posting a promotional shot of the pair to its <a href=#>Facebook</a> page on Thursday, July 3.</p><p>"Newlyweds Dave Coulier (Full House) & Melissa Bring support the freedom to marry for ALL couples," it said beside the snapshot. The campaign image, originally shot back in December 2011 by photographer and campaign co-founder, <strong>Adam Bouska</strong>, features Coulier and Bring in blinding white T-shirts.</p><p>In typical NOH8 imagery, the two have their mouths covered in duct tape and the "NOH8" brand stamped across their cheeks. Coulier sports scruff and stares at the camera with his pale blue eyes as he gives a peace sign. Bring, a photographer and producer, holds her left pointer finger in front of Coulier's sealed lips.</p><p>Coulier and Bring married Wednesday, July 2, in Paradise Valley, Mont., in front of guests <a href=#>including Coulier's former Full House family members</a>. Reunited costars <strong><a href=#>John Stamos</a></strong>, <strong>Candace Cameron Bure</strong>, <strong>Bob Saget</strong>, <strong>Andrea Barber</strong>, and show creator<strong> Jeff Franklin</strong> celebrated the nuptials by posting numerous photos to social media.</p><p>Bure, who played DJ Tanner on the show, gushed in one post: "Happy wedding day Dave & Melissa!!! I love you both SO much!!!</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Coulier exclusively confirmed his engagement news to <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> last month. "Melissa has been my best friend since I met her nine years ago," the comedian told <strong>Us</strong>. "I feel like the luckiest man on the planet. I get to marry my best friend, and she doesn't mind that I have a really bad gas problem."</p><p>The NOH8 Campaign is a charity organization that looks to promote marriage, gender, and human equality.
