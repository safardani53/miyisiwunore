Since this was Kendall’s first long-term relationship since <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her breakup</a> from <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Devin Booker</strong></a>, fans want to know what led to the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>model’s split</a> from the “MONACO” rapper. Additionally, a new report says that&nbsp;The Kardashians&nbsp;stars’ friends aren’t exactly shocked about her most recent split.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Keep reading to learn the reason why they called it quits.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Why Did Kendall and Bad Bunny Break Up?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>The catwalk queen and the Puerto Rican rapper split by the middle of December 2023, according to several outlets. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>Entertainment Tonight </i></a>reported that their breakup wasn’t bitter, citing a source that noted things began to “fizzle out” between them after a while.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Kendall and Bad Bunny have been doing their own things lately and things slowly started to fizzle out between them,” the insider told the outlet. “They both knew going into this that it likely wouldn’t be a forever type of relationship, and that was mutually understood from the get-go.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Since the two celebs have hectic work lives due to their respective careers, the source concluded that Kendall and Bad Bunny “have crazy busy schedules and know they’re still young and have a lot more to experience individually before settling down.” Nevertheless, there wasn’t “any negativity between them, and they still want the best for one another,” the insider added.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Kendall’s friends also “aren’t surprised” by the split, but they also wouldn’t be shocked if they had a bit of an on-and-off relationship, according to a new report from <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly.</a>&nbsp;“They never really saw their relationship going the distance anyway,” they said. “Of course, they want the best for their friend, but they really didn’t feel like Kendall was as compatible with Bad Bunny as she was in past relationships with other people.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Previously, Kendall got candid about her approach to romantic relationships. During her August 2023 interview with <i><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Harper’s Bazaar</a>,</i> the <i>Kardashians</i> star pointed out, “I love really hard, and I love without apology.” Kendall also said she tends to “fight for relationships” instead of giving up on them.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“I don’t like goodbyes, and I will fight to not have to say ‘goodbye,’” the reality star explained. “I will always fight for relationships. I’ve been that way since I was little, although I was shy and sometimes very closed off. I don’t give up on anything. Some people aren’t willing to meet me at that level. But that’s OK. I’d rather do that than shut myself off to something and not give it a proper chance.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>When Did Kendall and Bad Bunny Start Dating?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Although there wasn’t a formal confirmation of when <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their romance</a> began, Kendall and Bad Bunny first sparked relationship rumors in February 2023. Shortly thereafter, they were spotted in public together, going to private parties and getting photographed at NBA games.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>That September, Kendall and Bad Bunny partnered with Gucci for the brand’s travel collection. For the campaign, the <i>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</i> alum and the “La Romana” rapper posed for pictures together in an airport.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>The following month, Bad Bunny hosted <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, and Kendall went to an afterparty with her then-boyfriend. This was their last public outing together before they reportedly split.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Who Else Has Bad Bunny Dated?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Before he and Kendall started going out, Bad Bunny was linked to a few other women in the past. The Grammy Award winner previously dated <strong>Gabriela Berlingeri</strong> from around 2017 until 2022. In 2016, he proposed to ex <strong>Carliz De La Cruz</strong> four years after they first started dating. However, they split by the end of that year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahsGacmZl6rLHNnZilpF2fsq%2B6xKtkmqaUYq%2BisIybrKemqWKvs7HApGSuqF2eu7S1w55kraCVnr9uv8%2BloK1lZWd%2Bc3yXb2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wegmans-avocado-oil-chips-discontinued.html><span>←</span><span>Wegmans confirms popular fan favorite item is discontinued after customers beg for its return</span></a>
