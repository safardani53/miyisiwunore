Perfect for the occasion.” Someone else questioned: “@kimkardashian where can I wear this besides the bedroom? Is it supposed to give lingerie?”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Other fans were all about the look, scooping it up the second it hit the site. “Miss Kim knew exactly what she was doing with this one,” a user wrote, adding a fire emoji. “I need this,” another person commented.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Other fans pointed out that the crotchless design resembles a similar lineup from Rihanna’s Savage x Fenty lingerie line. “RIHANNA DID THIS ALREADY,” one person wrote, while another said, “It’s giving copy cat vibes @savagexfenty.” Rihanna made waves in summer 2021 when her fashion label released a crotchless legging design, along with crotchless catsuits. She also sells crotchless underwear.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>While fans may question Kardashian’s latest launch, the star’s brand has proved to be hugely successful.

The company even broke the internet with a first-of-its-kind collaboration with luxe fashion house Fendi, which dropped in October 2021.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The launch sold out nearly instantly and returned for a second drop in December 2021 due to high demand.
