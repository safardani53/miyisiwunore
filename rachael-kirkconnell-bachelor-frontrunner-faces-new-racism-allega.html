Kirkconnell was accused of racism by a former high school classmate who alleged that Matt James’ frontrunner used to bully white girls who dated people of color.
Rachael never responded to the allegations, and for a time, it looked as though there would be no further exploration of her alleged history of bigotry."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
