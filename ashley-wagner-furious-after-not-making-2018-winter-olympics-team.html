I am absolutely furious. I know when I go and I lay it down. I absolutely left one jump on the table, but for me to put out two programs like I did at this competition, as solid as I skated, and to get those scores, I am furious,” Wagner <a href=#>told reporters</a>&nbsp;in a post championships interview. “And I think deservedly so.”</p><p>“This is how I feel and I feel like need to stick up for myself. I delivered when I really needed to,” the Virginia-born athlete continued. “I want to be on that Olympic team and I’m really mad that I’m in this position again.”</p><p>The 26-year-old also took to Twitter on Saturday, January 6, and wrote, “As an athlete, I’m allowed to be mad. As a senior competitor with over 10 years of experience, I’m allowed to question things. At the end of the day, I laid out my best and I’m going home proud! Congrats to the lovely ladies of the team, you’ve got me in your cheering squad now!”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>As an athlete, I’m allowed to be mad.
