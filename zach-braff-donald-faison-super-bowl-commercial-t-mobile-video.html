Set to “I Feel Pretty,” <strong>Zach Braff </strong>starts off the T-Mobile ad frustrated with his Internet bill. “I feel defeated/feel mistreated / I’m so angry, I’m singing a song!” belts Zach as if he was on Broadway. From there, he vents his frustration, and his singing is heard by his neighbor, <strong>Donald Faison. </strong>“I’ve got T-Mobile internet!” he shouts before singing along. It seems that while Zach is left with poor download speeds and high bills, Donald has the opposite setup.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“Very happy!” he says. “Look how much money I’m saying now!” There is choreography, jubilation, and enough coordination that someone is already talking about these two getting a Tony (or an Emmy?) for this performance. In the end, Zach runs in to switch over to T-Mobile and switch. “Internet Without B.S.,” he sings in harmony with his former co-star (and best buddy.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Zach-Braff-Donald-Faison-Give-Fans-The-‘Scrubs-EMBED.jpg alt width=620 height=414 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I’m excited to see both Verizon and T-Mobile bring more visibility to this important and growing technology on such a big stage,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>writes</a> <strong>Dow Draper</strong>, Executive VP of Emerging Products, for T-Mobile. I’m also proud that T-Mobile continues to be unique in its customer-centric approach to home broadband, addressing industry pain points head-on. Our 5G Home Internet has no hidden fees, no exploding promotions, no “price locks,” and you don’t even have to be a wireless customer to get it. We’re making big, bold moves to change broadband for good and to connect millions of homes to reliable, fast, no BS internet.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>This isn’t T-Mobile’s only appearance during Super Bowl LVI. The Feb. 13 game will also see <strong>Dolly Parton </strong>and <strong>Miley Cyrus </strong>release a PSA and charity single about 5G phones stuck on mediocre 5G networks. Dolly delivers a PSA that would make <strong>Sarah McLachlan </strong>envious before Miley asks what she can do to help. Using the wise idiom “What Would Dolly Do?” she puts together a song – “Do It For The Phones” – a full song that will get stuck in your head until the end of the Super Bowl (and beyond some.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5BsZrOZk516o77An51mnJ%2Bjrq2wjJ%2BYoqufo3q0wc%2BeqWaan6y5bq%2FOpqSeqpOerq1502akqJqZobJuwsidnKhn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rescue-helps-gumby-kitten-with-limb-differences-find-home-8407550.html><span>←</span><span>Mass.
