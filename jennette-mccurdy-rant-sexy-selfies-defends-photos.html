I don’t claim to be, I don’t try to be, and I don’t want to be,” she wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Jennette&nbsp;referenced the leak of her selfies, too: “With the growing I’ve done, I realize that to attempt to live up to the idea of being a role model is to set myself up for foregone failure. Sure, I’ve made some mistakes, but even if I hadn’t, people would have found invisible ones.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“This world is one seemingly most keen on judgment and negativity.” We can’t really fault her logic, here, but she is also the one who uses Twitter as a battleground, as when she called her ex “ugly” and when she blasted a “trouble friend” —&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ariana Grande</strong></a>, basically.</p><h3>Jennette McCurdy: ‘I Am Proud Of The Way I Live My Life. I Am Proud Of My Choices’</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I am proud of the way I live my life,” <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she continued</a>. “I am proud of my choices. I am proud that no one can call me fake or say I don’t stand up for myself. I am proud that my friends and family would say that I’m a good person.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Jennette’s rant is pretty timely — just one day prior, she tweeted her condolences to ex-BFF and co-star Ariana Grande, whose beloved grandfather has just passed. It seems as if Jennette is trying to bury the hatchet and start fresh following all of the behind-the-scenes drama that had a hand in&nbsp;<a title="‘Sam & Cat’ Canceled: Why Did The Hit Show End After Only One Season?" href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sam & Cat‘s premature cancelation</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Jennette is a bright, funny, beautiful girl, and we’re glad to see that she seems to be moving on from recent difficulties!</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Here’s her rant in full:</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“I am not a role model.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>I don’t claim to be, I don’t try to be, and I don’t want to be.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>There was a time when I tried to live up to the aggrandizing title, that pedestal of a thing. Maybe it wasn’t so much that I was trying to live up to it. Perhaps I thought I could and I thought I was supposed to, so I gave it my best shot.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>It’s fine, I can admit it. Back in my adolescence, I was more amiable, bubbly, and on lightly humid days, maybe even flouncy. I was role model material and then some.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Fast forward a few years, I’ve grown up a bit (emphasis on “a bit”). I might not be any wiser, but I like to think I’m more honest.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>With the growing I’ve done, I realize that to attempt to live up to the idea of being a role model is to set myself up for foregone failure. Sure, I’ve made some mistakes, but even if I hadn’t, people would have found invisible ones. This world is one seemingly most keen on judgment and negativity, despite all the hearts and smiley emoticons.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>To remove myself from the role model battle, the falsified standard set by the bubblegum industry, is – in my eyes – to remove myself from the counterintuitive battle of attempting to be something perfect while being glaringly aware of my imperfections.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Sure, I still love my teddy bears. I still love a heart emoji (the white heart in the pink box is my favorite) and I still have a soft spot for American Girl dolls. I still love a cute dress, a good pop song, and a vanilla-scented candle. But these things don’t define me or determine that I am any kind of a role model. What defines a person as a role model is the way they live their life. And no offense, but none of you know how I live my life.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Now before you start thinking I’m some sort of derelict that leads a life of crime, let me clarify. I am proud of the way I live my life. I am proud of my choices. I am proud that no one can call me fake or say I don’t stand up for myself. I am proud that my friends and family would say that I’m a good person.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>But in order to be thought of as a real, true role model, I believe you have to know a person and their actions, inside and out. Calling a celebrity a role model is like calling a stranger a role model. The knowledge you have of a celebrity is no more than a caricature drawn by media tastemakers specializing in selling you an image you’re dying to buy. It’s good to have heroes, but you have to look for them in the right places. They say don’t look for true love in a bar, well I say, don’t look for role models on screens.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>For those of you who do consider me a role model, I hope you don’t read this and cringe. I appreciate you. I appreciate you so much! I appreciate that you believe in me, support me, and in some way, hope to live your life like me. But please, I encourage you to find role models in the people around you, the people in your everyday life, the people that are your friends and family. I encourage you to base your idea of a role model off of someone you know well enough to see purely, not in the light, cameras, and actions of Hollywood.</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>xo Jennette”</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>So,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what do you think about her lengthy missive? Do you agree that she’s not a role model? Was she ever a role model to you? Will she continue to be one to you, regardless of what she says? Let us know what you think!</p><p id=content-paragraph-22><strong>—&nbsp;Amanda Mitchell</strong></p><h3>More Jennette McCurdy&nbsp;News:</h3><li>Jennette McCurdy Sends Condolences To Ariana Grande — Feud Over?</li><li><a href=#>‘Sam & Cat’ Canceled: Why Did The Hit Show End After Only One Season?</a></li><li><a href=#>Jennette McCurdy Jealous Of Ariana Grande: Are They Still Friends?</a></li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlkZH14e5FtZqOdnqOytcDEZqScm6Wnsbp50ZqlrWWjmsW6edKeo5%2Bhlah6pbHFnqWdq12ltbDAzqxm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./george-benton-19330515-html.html><span>←</span><span>George Benton (Boxer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
