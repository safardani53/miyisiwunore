Vivian yelled “We won!” as she jumped up and down and Jack applauded.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gisele-Tom-Brady-kids-Super-Bowl-2021.jpg><p>Bündchen and the kids were rooting for the Florida football team and its quarterback, 43, long before they took the field over the weekend. Earlier this month, the Brazil native posted a sweet snap of herself and the kids decked out in Buccaneers gear.</p><p>“We are already cheering here papai!” she captioned the photo. “We love you! Let’s go @tombrady! Let’s go Bucs!!!”</p><p>Brady gushed about his family in the comments, writing, “The best cheering section in the WORLD.”</p><p>Sunday marked the University of Michigan alum’s 10th Super Bowl appearance. It was his first since leaving the New England Patriots in March 2020. Brady has won six of his previous appearances, with the 2021 Super Bowl becoming his 7th win.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gisele-Bundchen-Reacts-tp-Tom-Brady-and-the-Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers-Super-Bowl-2021-Q-1.jpg><p>Brady shocked the sports world when <a href=#>he announced his exit at the time</a>. The California native released a statement about his departure, writing, “FOREVER A PATRIOT.” He played for the Patriots for 20 years before signing a multi-million dollar deal with the Buccaneers.</p><p>“To all my teammates, coaches, executives and staff, Coach <strong>[Bill] Belichick</strong>, [owner <strong>Robert Kraft</strong>] and the Kraft family and the entire organization, I want to say thank you for the past 20 years of my life and the daily commitment to winning and creating a winning culture built on great values,” his statement read in part.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He’s not the only <a href=#>former New England Patriot who played a part</a> in Sunday’s Super Bowl LV victory. After retiring in 2019, <a href=#><strong>Rob Gronkowski</strong></a> returned to the NFL to play in Florida alongside Brady. The tight end told WEEI-FM in April 2020 the move wasn’t planned. “As a player, you always want to see what it is like somewhere else. [I] thought of that before, definitely after playing nine years in the NFL and I also thought about it when I came out of retirement,” he explained at the time, noting that things “just kind of lined up like that.”</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagoaOauaZ5wa6lnZuYmrtuvsSamq2rXam8bsDOpmSbqpGZxm7DyKeloqaXYsC2vMSrZJunp6F6c3yRamY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eddie-levert-19420616-html.html><span>←</span><span>Eddie Levert (Soul Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
