Patrick is one of up to 40 kids who attends the school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000492589815.jpg><p>Although these are some of the most disruptive children in the school system – screaming, biting, headbutting and spitting are all commonplace – not a single one is abandoned by Hawkswood. Headteacher Marie Gentles refuses to exclude kids, no matter what they do.</p><p>Her pupils are given hugs, never called "naughty", and a red and yellow 'traffic light' system teaches them about unacceptable behaviour.<br></p><h2>"They know how to make us feel happy"</h2><p>None of these techniques are ground-breaking, but they work - every Year Six student sat the recent SATs tests</p><p>Patrick was sent to Hawkswood last year and agrees the tactic works.</p><p>"They know how to make us feel happy,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000495153098-e1559653128648.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000492589792.jpg><p>"[My old school] didn’t really know how to handle me. I’d always run out of lesson... I used to throw chairs but if I do that now they just keep me safe."</p><p>Inspirational Marie estimates a quarter of the students risk being drawn into gangs – not surprising, as gang members are five-and-a-half times more likely to have been excluded from school than other kids.</p><p>"We’ve had a couple of children who have definitely been embroiled in a gang," she says.</p><h2>Boys more likely to be excluded than girls</h2><p>"However, we have more children who are vulnerable to being groomed by a gang, that’s the big thing."</p><p>The pupils are also almost all boys.</p><p>"We always have minimal girls," she adds. "At the moment, we have no girls in the juniors at all and one girl in the infants."</p><p>This isn't unusual for a PRU - for every girl, three boys are permanently excluded from school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000495153096-e1559653177900.jpg><p>But it's the rare female pupils who are the hardest work.</p><p>Just last year, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">BBC footage</a> captured a screaming five-year-old girl spitting in a teacher's face while being restrained by a technique known as "positive handling" at the unit.</p><p>This technique is used as a last resort for the safety of the child and others.</p><h2>Disruptive children who just want a hug</h2><p>"You're showing them you can keep them emotionally and physically safe," Marie says. "We’ve had children who, after a while, will say, 'Oh Miss, can you hold me like that please?' "We’ll say, 'We don’t have to hold you like that, we can just give you a hug.’"</p><p>Marie is adamant no child at her school will feel rejected, which is why she doesn’t exclude kids.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000495153095-e1559653211989.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GL-ES-COMPOSITE-Exclusions-in-England-v5.jpg><p>“We had a child here who was new about two months ago and was acting out really violently, really big. He said ‘Are you going to send me home?’" she says.</p><p>"I said, 'we’re not sending you home, you might be trying to hurt us but we still like you'. Within two weeks, he wasn’t displaying that behaviour anymore."</p><h2>Locks on front doors in case students try to bolt</h2><p>As I walked into the PRU the doors locked behind me - a safety measure in case any children in "fight or flight mode" try to bolt.</p><p>But inside all was quiet, and one little boy even ran to get me a chair.</p><p>"People are often surprised [by the calmness] but this is our expectation," says Marie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000492589813.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000492589814-e1558716215993.jpg><p>In one classroom, I found Patrick and his four classmates, all from very different backgrounds, looking at the stories they'd written about themselves the day before.</p><p>They'd 'jumped' 10 years into the future and imagined a series of events, including some horrible ones, happening to them (today, they were 'jumping back' and writing what they could have done differently).</p><h2>Teachers don't shy away from newsworthy issues</h2><p>Patrick's shocked me - gangs, drug dealing, guns, police chases, funerals - every sentence was riddled with tragedy.</p><p>But his teacher, Leah Mwaniki, doesn’t shy away from discussing these issues with students.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Shock school exclusion numbers</h3></p><p><strong>2,000 </strong>students excluded from school every day on average</p><p><strong>40</strong> kids permanently excluded every day</p><p><strong>352</strong> pupil referral units (PRUs) in England</p><p><strong>78%</strong> of permanent exclusions are issued to children with special education needs (SEN)</p><p><strong>1%</strong> of excluded children get five good GCSEs they need to succeed</p><p><strong>74% </strong>of children in PRUs are persistently absent</p><p><strong>40% </strong>of kids are not in education, employment or training when they leave PRUs at 16</p><p><strong>71%</strong> of children in PRUs are white British</p><p><strong>63% </strong>of prisoners were suspended or temporarily excluded as kids</p><p><strong>85%</strong> of children in young offender institutions have been excluded</p><p><strong>&nbsp;1,572</strong> primary school children aged between five and 10 who were in PRUs last year</p><p><strong>£2.1billion... </strong>how much experts say every year group of permanently excluded pupils will additionally cost the state in education, health, benefits and criminal justice costs</p><p>“Gangs, knife crime, everything, we have to address," says Leah, who has worked at the unit for eight years after making the move from mainstream schools like Marie.</p><p>“We’re not going to hide anything about drugs; we’re going to speak about it because most of them, or some of them, are exposed to it."</p><h2>PRUs targeted by 'county lines' gangs</h2><p>PRUs have become key targets for 'county lines' gangs, who groom thousands of vulnerable youngsters to shuttle and sell Class A drugs.</p><p>Marie, 39, says students as young as seven can be targeted: "The children are so vulnerable that they don’t even know they’re being groomed.”</p><p>Hawkswood teachers are trained to look out for the signs a student is being groomed: suddenly wearing new clothes, talking about money, or mentioning new names.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000495153099-e1559653248586.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000492589798.jpg><p>Teachers go to extreme lengths to protect the kids too – if a parents lets an older student travel to and from school by themselves, a teacher will take them to the bus stop the first few times.</p><p>"Safeguarding is absolutely paramount here," Marie says.</p><p>Because Hawkswood is a short-term intervention, many students reintegrate back into mainstream education within 15 to 20 weeks, with most doing so successfully.</p><h2>Words "naughty" and "bad" are banned</h2><p>Teachers are also careful not to call kids “naughty” or “bad”, instead focusing on why certain behaviours are unacceptable.</p><p>As part of this, they have lessons on behaviour modification (as well as the national curriculum), to help them when they reintegrate.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">A generation of 'forgotten' children</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>ROB Halfon, Tory MP and Chair of the Select Committee on Education in the House of Commons, has backed The Sun's series.</p><p>He says <a data-mce-href=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9165911/rob-halfon-forgotten-kids-lost-generation-exclusions/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">far too many pupils are being excluded from schools</a>, often on dubious grounds.</p><p>"The rush to exclude is one of the greatest social injustices of our times," he says.</p><p>"It is our modern age’s equivalent of the Victorian workhouse. If left unchecked, this trend will create generations of forgotten children — and our society will pay a savage price for that cruelty."</p><p>Mr Halfon has called on the Government to take "radical action".</p><p>A lot is expected of the kids but it seems to work.</p><p>Marie is fiercely proud of what the children have achieved, especially as when she arrived at Hawkswood she expected to find kids fighting, swearing and an out-of-control atmosphere.</p><h2>"Stigma" of PRU children</h2><p>But while some youngsters do fit the "stigma" of a PRU child - being from a broken home or a disadvantaged area - others don't.</p><p>Many have working parents and, while figures show excluded and off-rolled kids are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">more likely to have special educational needs (SEND)</a>, a lot of Hawkswood students don't.</p><p>But most of them do need to learn that actions have consequences.</p><p>So "wrong choices" incur verbal, 'yellow' and 'red' warnings, or time penalties which have to be 'paid back' during the after-school club at the end of the day.</p><p>Like most PRUs, Hawkswood is getting more and more children through its doors. Last year, 1,572 primary school children aged between five and 10 were in PRUs - up from 715 in 2011.</p><p><span>But at the same time, funds are being slashed.</span></p><h2>Excluded pupils cost state £2.1 billion in future</h2><p>"It’s so hard because you’re cutting from the most vulnerable," says Marie.</p><p>"I strongly feel that later on it’s costing us more anyway.”</p><p>Experts say every year group of permanently excluded pupils ends up costing the state £2.1billion in education, health, benefits and criminal justice costs.</p><p>Marie suggests better training for teachers in mainstream schools could cut the amount of exclusions by helping them deal with challenging kids, but it’s not the full answer.</p><p>"There are always going to be those individuals with a slightly higher level of need who will need an alternative provision, like a PRU," she says.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Top stories in news</h2></p><p>Marie believes no child should be condemned as unteachable – and Patrick showed why, when he reflected on what he wants out of life in his second story.</p><p>"When my exclusion is over I am going to prove all the teachers I can do it and going to leave Hawkswood a successful young man,” he wrote.</p><p>With many children's futures left in tatters the moment they're excluded from school, I hope for Patrick's sake he defies the odds and does just that.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">What can kids be excluded for?</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>THE decision to permanently exclude a student is a huge one that can impact on their long-term future</p><p>According to statutory guidance released by the Department for Education, such action should only be taken:</p><ul><li><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">In response to a serious breach or persistent breaches of the school's behaviour policy</span></li><li>Where allowing the pupil to remain in school would seriously harm the education or welfare of the pupil or others in the school</li></ul><p>Reasons for exclusion might include bullying, arson, vandalism, drug dealing, alcohol abuse, persistant disruptive behaviour, physical assault or racist abuse,.</p><p>Youngsters who repeatedly fail to either follow academic instruction or complete a <span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">behavioural sanction, like a detention, may also find themselves kicked out.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfbn50fpBuaWihnqi2pbGMqaypoZxiv6ayxKupmqRdqruqwIywn56qlWK4qrDSZpisZamkwq%2BzjJqqZp6Zq7JurdGeZJuqkaOxprCMrqWtnZGYtaKuy55km62kYq6tuIytn56xXaeyorjLsmSwmZ6peqq%2FjJpkoa2XZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charlie-bothuell-found-after-11-days-missing-boys-father-reacts.html><span>←</span><span>Charlie Bothuell Found After 11 Days; Missing Boy's Father Reacts in Stunned Silence on Nancy Grace</span></a>
