The specially-designed ceramic barrel will help transform your hair, giving the ultimate smoothness and style. The ceramic heaters work to streamline the styling process using microchip technology so you can curl your hair with one pass of the iron in each section.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I’ve been loving my T3 SinglePass ceramic curling iron,” celebrity hairstylist Mara Roszak tells PEOPLE. “The hair is shiny and not overheated.” With a heat range up to 430ºF, this curling iron can <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>help tame the curliest of curls</a>, creating a frizz-free finish. But it also has lower temperature settings that work well for fine hair. “This type of curling iron is great if you have more natural textured hair, and you like the extra heat as it goes to a hotter setting if that's what you need,” celebrity hairstylist and founder of Arkive Headcare Adam Reed tells PEOPLE. “The key is to master whether you want a curl or wave&nbsp; — each different result requires a different technique.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, the size (1.25-inch) allows for a wide variety of curls — large and loose curls, more defined curls, and even softer beachy waves. “My personal favorite curlers and irons are from T3 Micro,” celebrity hair specialist Joseph Michael tells PEOPLE. This curling iron in particular is ideal for medium to long hair, especially if you have naturally curly hair, but we think the price, features, and backing by experts make this curling iron an excellent choice for best overall.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Temperature: </strong>Up to 430ºF |<strong> Barrel Size:</strong> 1.25” | <strong>Material: </strong>Ceramic</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-conair-double-ceramic-1-12-inch-curling-iron></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Conair Double Ceramic 1 1/2-Inch Curling Iron</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Conair Double Ceramic 1 1/2-Inch Curling Iron" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/5hKdIAMH1DXbmJf8PxeenJfuD8s=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Conair-Double-Ceramic-1-1-2-Inch-Curling-Iron-3cff10deb60040bca5daff88c2bff7e0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re balling on a budget, this ceramic curling iron from Conair creates beautiful curls without a steep price tag. With sizes of 1, 1.25, and 1.5 inches, this curling iron can work on different lengths of hair, and form several types of curls. The temperatures go up to 400ºF, so be cautious when clamping the ceramic plate over your hair so you don’t burn your finger (though the tip stays cool as a safe touch point).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While it does get hot, there are 30 unique heat settings on this curling iron, so it’s versatile for different hair types and textures. For instance, if you have fine hair and want to use a lower heat setting, you could set it to 250ºF versus if you have super thick hair, you might want to use the higher settings like 375ºF or even 400ºF. It only takes 30 seconds to heat up (with dual voltage settings), so this hot tool can also save some time in your morning beauty routine. And if you get nervous about accidentally leaving your curling iron on, this one has an automatic shut-off function.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Temperature: </strong>Up to 400ºF |<strong> Barrel Size:</strong> 1”, 1.25”, and 1.5” | <strong>Material: </strong>Ceramic</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-dyson-airwrap-multi-styler-complete-long></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Splurge</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dyson Airwrap</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dyson Airwrap Multi-Styler" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/f67CWzuqtj1VgKG0MSvveHfIJ0c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/airwrap-multistyler-complete-long-dyson-2bc69a951bec42a992d8e7b3a4d3fee2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our splurge pick is the famous Dyson Airwrap — deemed the "holy grail of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hot air brushes</a>." The hot tool comes with several attachments for trying different types of curls as well as blow drying and styling your hair, essentially simulating the same experience as a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>rotating curling iron</a>. “I have been a fan of hot rollers and curling irons all my life, and I've also been using the same set of rollers and the same curling iron for... almost all my life, so it was time for an upgrade,” PEOPLE senior commerce editor Erin Johnson says. “I received the Dyson Airwrap set as a holiday gift, and it was so beautiful that I was a little intimidated to actually use it. I watched a YouTube tutorial, and then I just started experimenting with the tools.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Using Coanda airflow instead of extreme heat, the Dyson Airwrap collects your hair and wraps it around the barrel — effectively curling it using air pressure. “I got the hang of it quickly, and I can't believe I didn't invest in something like this sooner,” Johnson says. “This set gives my hair volume, yet it also keeps it smooth (which is a rare thing because I have very dry hair).”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“The Dyson Airwrap is very interesting to me, and I recommend it to clients for at-home use,” says Roszak. “It seems like a game-changer for clients with finer hair that want an easy blowout with some waves,” says the stylist who works with clients like Zoe Saldana, Olivia Wilde, and Grace Van Patten.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The set comes with a dryer, two Airwrap barrels, two smoothing brushes, and one volume brush. And while this tool is designed for medium to long hair lengths, there’s also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a sister product </a>designed for short hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Most importantly, it creates really perfect curls that don't fall out,” Johnson adds. “When I'm done using the Airwrap, I look like I just got a blowout. I know the price tag is high, but if you can afford it and you know you'll actually use it, this set is worth the money.” It certainly makes for a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>luxurious gift</a> for anyone who loves styling their own hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Temperature: </strong>Up to 302ºF |<strong> Barrel Size:</strong> 1.2” and 1.6” | <strong>Material: </strong>Steel<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-set-t3-twirl-trio-interchangeable-clip-curling-iron-set-1-125-15></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Set</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>T3 Twirl Trio Curling Iron</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Interchangeable Clip Barrel Iron T3 TWIRL TRIO" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/U2GGt8Rdfo4Bk1MPqN15eOl24j0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/interchangeable-clip-barrel-iron-t3-twirl-trio-723960150cb4458685e46b75e560ab4a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>T3 Micro</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Using five heat settings that go up to 410ºF, this curling iron set works on a wide range of hair types and textures. It heats up quickly, and shuts off automatically after an hour so you don’t have to stress about whether you left it on or not. The tip stays cool to avoid any finger burns, and it has a nine-foot cord for maximum mobility whether you’re a professional or curling your hair at home.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Michael is one such hairstylist who swears by the T3 sets. “Its Convertible Collection allows for an interchangeable design which gives you infinite styling possibilities,” says Michael. The complete set “comes with seven different interchangeable curlers and smart microchip and high-performance ceramic heaters that deliver heat fast " (though this trio is just part of the wider collection that he mentions).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With three attachment barrels at 1-inch and 1.25- and 1.5-inches that easily lock into a convertible base, this curling iron is highly versatile. It can create defined curls all the way up to loose bouncy curls. “It also has 5 heat settings, auto world voltage for around-the-world use, and smart technology that shuts the irons off after one hour,” he says. The ceramic plate also helps reduce any frizz to create shiny smooth hair after use. Plus, it comes with a travel case, so this set is easy to pack and protect while on the go. “These irons have been my go-to for years,” Michael says. “They work great with any hair texture and always leave the hair looking so silky and healthy.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Temperature: </strong>Up to 410ºF |<strong> Barrel Size:</strong> 1”, 1.25”, and 1.5” | <strong>Material: </strong>Ceramic<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jessica Juliao</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-rotating-chi-air-spin-n-curl-ceramic-rotating-hair-curler></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Rotating</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>CHI Air Spin N Curl Hair Curler</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Chi Air Spin N Curl Ceramic Rotating Hair Curler" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/VA8gePPKhzBu811ogmLgtRdncC4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/chi-air-spin-n-curl-ceramic-rotating-hair-curler-f51a1d3b2a3f4d1b8052f733e41ff5cf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This rotating curling iron from Chi creates beautiful curls without fear of heat damage or burning your hand from having to wrap the hair around the physical iron. It uses a chamber that (gently) sucks hair in, wraps it around the barrel, and is heated and timed so your hair isn’t resting on a hot surface for too long. Because of its mechanism, it’s really better suited for shoulder-length hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are three pre-set heat settings for different types of hair: 370ºF for fine hair, 390ºF for medium hair, and 410ºF for coarse hair, which helps take some of the guesswork out of your beauty routine. This rotating curling iron is easy to use all around (you literally just push a button), and it even tells you when it’s time to release the hair. And for added safety, it shuts off after an hour to prevent being accidentally left on.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Temperature: </strong>370ºF-410ºF |<strong> Barrel Size:</strong> 1” | <strong>Material: </strong>Ceramic</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cordless-belisa-by-lunata-1-cordless-curling-iron></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Cordless</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Belisa By Lunata 1” Cordless Curling Iron</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Belisa By Lunata 1&amp;acirc; Cordless Curling Iron" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/7uK2SUcfQAE08tjvbpAT8XuSE2I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Belisa-By-Lunata-1-Cordless-Curling-Iron-adb309a361714cafbdf781b3a2eca51e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>Since it has a shorter running time and lower maximum heat setting due to its lack of cord, this wouldn’t be as great for someone with thick hair since it takes longer and needs higher heat to curl all of it.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Say goodbye to battling a cord when curling your hair, because this curling iron is completely cordless. As such, it can only be used disconnected for up to 35 minutes at a time, followed by 2.5 hours of charging with the accompanying cable (it can be used while charging). It operates at a maximum temperature of 400ºF, though it does have 20 heat settings that work for short to long hair.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The benefits of a cordless curling iron are numerous, but perhaps the most notable is portability, like using a hot tool in a space that might not be conducive to many outlets, or even while riding in the passenger seat on the way to an event (hey, you never know). The titanium plate holds heat well and disperses it evenly, so your curls can be balanced in volume and shape.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Temperature: </strong>200ºF-400ºF |<strong> Barrel Size:</strong> 1” | <strong>Material: </strong>Titanium</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-portable-harry-josh-pro-tools-travel-curling-iron-125-inch></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Portable</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Harry Josh Pro Tools Travel Curling Iron 1.25-Inch</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=640 data-sizes=750px alt="Harry Josh Pro Tools Travel Curling Iron" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Y_twb3PxP0PB891JuvgNzVAlsiE=/fit-in/1500x640/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/harryjosh-d32c0b9fc5eb4a549ba4a3172be8f99e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dermstore</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>This curling iron is perfect for someone who travels frequently, because it fits compactly in a bag, and can be used on-the-go.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you’re considering a hot tool for travel, you’ll want something compact with universal voltage capabilities, and this curling iron embodies both of these qualities. Equipped with 100-240V, 50-60Hz, and 50W, you can take it wherever you go without fear that it will blow a fuse. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Celebrity hairstylist Yusef</a> told PEOPLE in a previous interview that he even caused the power in the Chanel store to go out while doing Rihanna’s hair with other tools during Paris Fashion Week several years back.

But with the small size comes the challenge of curling longer or thicker hair. It’s doable, but might affect the tightness of the curl. The heat settings are quite high, reaching up to 425ºF, and with a nano-ceramic plate, this curling iron is still able to create voluminous curls. Additional safety features include an auto-shut off function after an hour, a heat-resistant tip to have a cool spot to hold when curling your hair, and a 360-degree swivel cord so it doesn’t get tangled while using it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Temperature: </strong>325ºF-425ºF |<strong> Barrel Size:</strong> 1.25” | <strong>Material: </strong>Nano-ceramic</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-triple-barrel-alure-three-barrel-curling-iron></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Triple Barrel</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Alure Curling Iron</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Alure Three Barrel Curling Iron" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/tY4r8ww9p0QIbxxxVi7OIwJlhuI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/alure-three-barrel-curling-iron-d29fe82dcab342d3896147b925bdae3c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those who want beach-y waves and an easier hack to get them, let us introduce this triple-barrel curling iron from Alure. With three barrels instead of one, this iron works as a hot clamp, crimping the hair in sections as you move from root to end (leaving about two inches of space between your head and where you start with the iron).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Considering it heats up in seconds (jumping to 410ºF), and you don’t have to feed a strand of hair around an iron and turn it for every curl, it takes less time to use, which is great for a morning routine. The ceramic plate contains negatively charged ions which also work to smooth out hair while you’re styling it for a more polished finish. It saves time, creates fun beachy waves, and comes in under $50 — this triple-barrel iron is not even a question, it’s a must.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Temperature: </strong>Up to 410ºF |<strong> Barrel Size:</strong> 1” | <strong>Material: </strong>Ceramic</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-curling-wand-drybar-the-wrap-party-styling-wand></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Curling Wand</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Drybar The Wrap</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Drybar The Wrap Party Styling Wand" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/42o29PpHQ2q7aL11FUB5LxwpG1g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/DryBarTheWrap1-47ea226a96974aecb48814aa64dab181.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>It’s not good for those who rely on the clamp on a curling iron to hold the hair, because as a wand, it doesn’t have one.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The main difference between a traditional curling iron and a wand is the metal plate that clamps down to hold the hair in place so you don’t have to manually hold it. This styling wand from Drybar is just the barrel (sans clamp) so you have to wrap the individual strands around the wand yourself, which can be a hazard if not wearing a protective glove (or just being extra cautious).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With two barrel sizes at 1- and 1.25-inches, this wand can create loose or tight curls depending on how closely together you wrap the strands of hair. The barrel is also ceramic which helps smooth out hair due to negatively charged ions (science can be cool). All things considered, this is a good pick for someone who curls their hair frequently and prefers the style of a wand to a traditional iron.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Temperature: </strong>150ºF to 450ªF |<strong> Barrel Size:</strong> 1” and 1.25” | <strong>Material: </strong>Ceramic</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-beginners-beachwaver-co-pro-1-curling-iron></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Beginners</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Beachwaver Co.

To use, you place the very end of a section of hair under the small clamp at the base of the barrel and then press on one of the two buttons at the base. The Beachwaver should be held vertically and facing away from you, so the button on the left should be used when you’re curling the hair on the left side of your face, and the right button for the right side. (However, once you pass your front sections, you can curl in any direction you choose — alternating directions will create a more natural look while keeping with the same direction on each side will create a more uniform look.) Once you press the button, the curling iron rotates, curls, and you simply release and pull the iron straight down after a few seconds of holding to reveal a perfect wavy-curl.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This particular model (the pro) is designed for medium to extra long hair. Invented by celebrity hairstylist Sarah Potempa, the Beachwaver is designed for all users, hair types, and curls — defined, glamorous, and beach-y.

Since it’s a wand, you don’t have to take the time to clamp the hair down before turning it —&nbsp;instead, just wrap each section of hair around the barrel, hold for 15 seconds or so, and then release. It’s easy to work around the different sections of your hair with this wand, just be cautious to not burn your hands if you are styling in a hurry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, this curling iron uses infrared heat (up to 450°F) to create voluminous curls that last, and lessens the risk of heat damage.

This option from GHD has a pre-set temperature of 365ºF which the brand claims is the optimum styling temperature to minimize hair damage. Plus it heats up in 25 seconds for absolute efficiency when you need to style your hair in a hurry. “I love using the GHD 1" Classic curling iron because of its gentle yet firm grip on the hair as well as the built-in temperature control it offers that makes it safe for all hair types,” says Stenson.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This tool does have a clamp, but Reed says this is optional depending on the type of curl you want. “I use a GHD tong (with clamp), but consumers will often use a wand as they find it easier to wind and work with, without clamping down the hair,” Reed says. “You can still wind with a tong without opening the clamp if you would prefer, which then helps to give a variation in types of curl if you're comfortable to work with a tong.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I also love my GHD classic curl wand,” says Roszak. “GHD is temperature-controlled which makes it easy to use and eliminates any confusion around how hot it should be.

The barrel sizes (1-inch and 1.25 inches) create beautiful voluminous curls you can wear for any occasion, day or night. Combined with safety features like two hour auto shut off and universal voltage, we think this is a great choice.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-103 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Temperature: </strong>Up to<strong> </strong>450ºF |<strong> Barrel Size:</strong> 1” and 1.25” | <strong>Material: </strong>Titanium</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-curly-hair-hot-tools-pro-24k-gold-curling-iron></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Curly Hair</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hot Tools Pro 24K Gold Curling Iron</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=Hot-tools-pro-24k-gold-curling-iron style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/6RXWOFPSmqXHHiKeJfxm1OjadPc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hot-tools-pro-24k-gold-curling-iron-d6713fe481204fa4a8842799f3125a2d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=3><p>It’s good for creating waves and curls, as well as restoring volume to hair, and heats quickly, distributing heat evenly.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-106 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This curling iron offers versatility in heat settings and barrel sizes for a lower price — making it a great pick for different types of curls and hair. The thinner barrel (0.75 inch) is ideal for shorter hair, tight curls, or for building soft beachy waves for a more casual look. As the barrels grow in size, so do the curls, so the 1-, 1.25-, and 1.5-inch barrels would work well for a range of looser curls and waves.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-107 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As a gold-plated curling iron, this hot tool heats quickly and distributes heat evenly, making it ideal for curly and thick hair.

To utilize the swivel function of this curling iron, you just clamp the hair and curl it once like normal, and then bring the barrel underneath the section you just curled (using a swivel or twisting motion), and it creates a twist that you can separate to form natural-looking loose curls.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-122 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With four temperature settings designed for different hair types and textures, this curling iron works for everyone. It even has dual voltage so you can take it abroad. It uses a special negative ionic technology to conduct heat, which helps smooth your hair, remove frizz, and make the curls last all day. It basically seals the cuticle of the hair follicle so the curl locks in place, at least for 24 hours or so. Overall, we love this curling iron for loose curls and beach-y waves.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-123 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Temperature: </strong>300ºF to 450ºF |<strong> Barrel Size:</strong> 1” | <strong>Material: </strong>Titanium</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-curling-iron></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying a Curling Iron</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Barrel Size</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">All of the experts agree. Barrel size comes down to your goals and the type of curl you’re seeking. “When I am choosing a curling iron, I choose the size of my iron depending on what result I am looking for,” says Reed. “The barrel size will directly create the sized-curl or wave.“ According to Stenson, you should also “keep in mind that smaller barrels produce more of a curl formation in the hair and larger barrels offer more shaping and volume.” The experts suggest a 1-inch barrel for classic curls and waves, and as Stenson adds “for someone that has trouble keeping curls in their hair all day.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you prefer a larger barrel, “I would use a 1.5-inch barrel curling iron for voluminous curls and waves with more of a bouncy blowout look,” says Michael. He also recommends this size for thick and coarse hair textures. “Finer textures have a tendency for dropping out curls quicker, so the tighter irons [editor's note: like the 1.25-inch] achieve full glamorous curls and waves,” says Michael. And if you want to go even smaller? “0.75-inch curling irons are used for delicate, defined curls, or enhanced natural curls”, he says, adding 0.5 curling irons create "tight, defined coils."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Temperature</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These tools bring the heat, so you have to keep temperature in mind when selecting the right curling iron for your hair. “Heat settings are key in creating the right amount of heat for different hair types and needs and a basic rule of thumb is, the higher the heat, the more intense the curl,” says Stenson. Michael looks at the texture of his clients’ hair when assessing what temperature to set the tool at. “For very thick hair I like to use the settings between 410-450ºF,” he says. He adds that coarse textures can be curled between 370-410ºF; wavy between 350-370ºF; combination or straight hair at 330-350ºF; and fragile and fine hair between 250-300ºF.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Essentially, don’t exceed 365ºF for fine and fragile hair, and know that you can curl most hair types at or under 410ºF, adds Stenson. “It’s also important to utilize a heat protection product anytime we utilize a heat tool,” he says. Reed agrees, saying “Build up your heat protection with products such as an oil, then a heat protectant such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Arkive Hair Primer</a>,” (a product in Reed’s new headcare line) “and then ensure your hair is completely dry ahead of using a heated tool.” He adds, “Heat protectant also allows for a beautiful hold in the hair, and of course, helps to prevent damage.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The main type of material on a flat iron is the plate, which is usually gold, titanium, or ceramic.

If you want something looser, you can wind or twist the hair as you're wrapping it which will give you more of a wave than a curl.”</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Are titanium or ceramic curling irons better?</span></p><p>“When selecting a curling iron, keep in mind that ceramic irons tend to offer a more gentle and less damaging heat for fine and delicate hair types, while titanium tends to work better for curl-resistant or more dense hair types,” says Stenson. As far as a preference? “I love using ceramic irons, as I find the curls hold better,” says Roszak. “There is enough heat to obviously create a curl, but it doesn’t overheat the hair, resulting in the hair falling flat.”</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What kind of curling iron gives you waves?</span></p><p>Generally, creating waves comes from technique over a specific iron, but there are qualities of an iron that can help, such as shape and temperature. “You can create a wave by winding your hair as you curl,” says Reed. “This will mean that you're not creating such a perfectly formed curl and allowing more movement and variation in the hair.”</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-take-our-word-for-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Take Our Word for It</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Madison Yauger</a> is a seasoned writer who’s tested hundreds of lifestyle products across all categories.
