Variety <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">states</a> that cameras run 24 hours a day for over 13 weeks. More than 13,000 hours of footage is collected each season, which is cut down into 18 episodes.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><p>Older seasons featured grainy filming quality but over the years, Deadliest Catch has secured top-of-the-line equipment to capture the best shots in tough conditions, as well as lower light levels. The team previously relied on infrared cameras at night but is now utilizing Sony’s small, light-sensitive A7S among others.</p><p>With equipment worth thousands of dollars,<a href=#> Discovery Channel</a> must protect them with large zip-lock bags – the ultimate waterproof yet lightweight camera cover.</p><p>Fixed cameras are most convenient when capturing key action, particularly during high-pressure situations such as injuries or men overboard as the camera crew would prioritize saving crew members.</p><p>As for aerial shots, helicopter cameramen film wide angles of the fishing vessels. Chase boats with cameramen also sail beside ships to low angles. They can also serve as emergency rescue boats. In season 16 episode 11, a chase boat was called for the first time in series history.</p><p>Helicopter cameraman David Alan Arnold regularly shows behind-the-scenes footage of filming on <a href=#>TikTok</a>:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@davidalanarnold href=#>@davidalanarnold</a><p>It’s never boring here. <a title=deadliestcatch href=#>#DeadliestCatch</a> <a title=behindthescenes href=#>#BehindtheScenes</a> <a title=cameraman href=#>#Cameraman</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - David Alan Arnold" href=#>♬ original sound – David Alan Arnold</a></figure>View TikTok<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-is-deadliest-catch-s-filming-location>Where is Deadliest Catch’s filming location?</h2><p>Deadliest Catch is filmed in the Bering Sea, around Alaska’s Aleutian Islands, which is known for its King Crab fishing industry. Fishing season takes place between October and January but seasons have previously closed due to low abundance as a result of climate change.</p><p>In October 2023, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game <a href=# rel=nofollow>announced</a> that fishermen are allowed to harvest red king crab for the first time in two years, but snow crabs remain off-limits for the second year in a row.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-to-watch-online>How to watch online</h2><p>Fans can catch up with previous seasons of Deadliest Catch on <a href=#>Discovery Plus</a> for a $4.99 per month subscription.
