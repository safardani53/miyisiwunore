From the insanity that was the Fyre Festival to the followers of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh in Wild Wild Country, these nonfiction narratives have really dialed into what strange creatures we humans can be.</p><p>But none of these docs have turned us into the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">White Guy Blinking GIF</a> quite so acutely as <a href=#>Abducted in Plain Sight</a>. &nbsp;The story of Jan Broberg's two kidnappings by family friend Robert Berchtold — especially details about how her parents responded to the kidnappings — have audiences asking... "Wait, what did I just watch? Is this real life?"</p><p>These 15 Abducted Plain Sight memes perfectly encapsulate the 90-minute wild ride.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. Literally same.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Viewers generally agree the 22-minute mark is when the WTF really sets in and doesn't let up again until the credits roll. And even then, this movie really does stay with you. I still think about it and shudder a few times a day.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. This all-purpose meme seems tailor-made for 'AIPS'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>This evergreen tweet from November 2018 applies to a lot of things, but none quite so succinctly as the feeling of watching Abducted in Plain Sight.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. When politeness goes too far.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>If you haven't yet seen the doc — spoiler alert — Jan's dad relates an experience where his daughter's soon-to-be abductor asked his buddy to help him get some "relief" because he wasn't getting it at home. And so... he did? Because he didn't want to be rude I think? Yeah, I'm still shaking my head.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. Even Netflix UK can't even.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>You know your content is really provocative when even you can't believe it exists in the world.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. Threat level: critical yikes.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Maximum yikes, guys. People are dwelling a lot on the way this movie lends new meaning to the phrase "lend a hand to a friend," but that's just the beginning with this story.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. Fyre Fest vs. 'AIPS'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Life comes at you pretty fast, especially when you're watching Netflix docs. If Netflix keeps up this pace, December is going to be WILD.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. FIVE DAYS.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>This mother waited five days to call the cops when her daughter went missing. FIVE DAYS. If you haven't seen this movie yet, just know that you will periodically find yourself shouting "FIVE DAYS" to no one in particular for at least five days after watching.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. Choose your own nightmare.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>If this had been a plot line in <a href=#>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</a> I'm pretty sure a lot of viewers would've noped out of there with a quickness.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9. 'AIPS' summed up in one text</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Look, it's great to trust your friends. But trust doesn't mean turning off your BS detector. I'm pretty sure the Brobergs were born without the BS detector gene.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">10. The fury is just never-ending.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Honestly, even at 90 minutes — pretty short as far as Netflix true crime documentaries go — this film is a true endurance test. How much outrage and incredulity can you withstand? Watch and find out.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">11. Beware the white man.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Seriously, every white dude with even an iota of charisma is suspect these days.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">12. The inevitable 'Bird Box' callback.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Jan's parents definitely would have survived to the end of Bird Box. They have the most severe case of willfull blindness I've ever witnessed.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">13. The Stefon Seal of Approval</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Again, all of this is folded into just 90 minutes of television. Truly, you guys, W. T. F.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">14. I need some relief... headache relief.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>This image works two ways. On the one hand, it's an accurate depiction of how your whole head will hurt after watching this movie. Or it could be a balaclava, which you can put over your face to avoid that headache.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">15. Ew, David.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>It's hard to pick one GIF of David Rose from Schitt's Creek to encapsulate the mixture of disgust, confusion, and indignation you will feel during Abducted in Plain Sight. Just use all of them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKyimrultc2gZmtoYW58cX6OamlohJOshYWhkrKBaJmSmcKkwMSdZKKmXaW5orXNZqqin5ipeq6xzJ6q</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wade-desarmo-rj99-html.html><span>←</span><span>Wade DesArmo (Skateboarder) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
