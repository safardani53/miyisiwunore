a stir yesterday as he was snapped in floral swimming trunks on the beach in Barbados.</p><p>The heir to the throne <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">looked buff at 70 as he frolicked among the waves</a> – but he’s not the only royal family member to have stripped off to reveal their beach body.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT0004770424921.jpg><p>Here, Fabulous Digital has rounded up some sun-soaked snaps of the famous family kicking back and relaxing on their holidays...<br></p><h2>Prince Harry</h2><p>Dashing Prince Harry raised temperatures when he was pictured soaking up some rays in the Caribbean, and it wasn’t due to his flaming red hair.</p><p>Sporting some red swimming shorts and sunglasses, the dashing prince looked relaxed in 2007 as he spent time in Barbados, like his dad.</p><p>Unlike Prince Charles, Prince Harry reportedly rode the Caribbean waves on a wakeboard, showing off the lean Windsor genes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000003560940.jpg><p>He is now happily married to Meghan Markle, but this trip was spent with young sweetheart Chelsy Davy, who was captured watching her boyfriend playing on the surf.<br></p><h2>Meghan Markle</h2><p>Being a lover of yoga and regular fitness, it’s no surprise that Prince Harry’s new wife Meghan Markle looks sensational in swimwear.</p><p>When she married film producer Trevor Engelson in 2011, she was snapped in a yellow bikini during the sun-drenched celebrations in Jamaica.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000292643885.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT0003700934601.jpg><p>She also posted an eye-catching photo doing an impressive yoga move in a two-piece swimsuit on her now-deleted personal Instagram account.</p><p>Looks like we’ll be booking into a yoga-class asap!</p><h2>Prince William</h2><p>He may be the heir to the throne, but Prince William knows how to unwind in the sun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000477304337.jpg><p>The future king was spotted enjoying some rest and relaxation on a swanky yacht near Ibiza, with his then-girlfriend Kate Middleton in 2006.</p><p>Looking like he’d caught the sun, the royal was pictured having some down-time on the top deck wearing some fetching red swimming shorts.<br></p><h2>Kate Middleton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000477304335.jpg><p>Kate Middleton caught Prince William’s eye as she strutted her stuff in a see-through outfit on a fashion catwalk at the University of St Andrews, when they were both students.</p><p>And she looked every inch the movie star as she lounged in a white Bond girl-esque bikini on the luxury yacht with her partner in Spain during their break.</p><p>Showing off washboard abs and lean legs, the tanned royal-to-be certainly showed why she stood out for Prince William.<br></p><h2>Pippa Middleton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000459729002.jpg><p>Kate’s sister Pippa also clearly inherited the sporty Middleton genes, and can certainly rock a bikini on the beach like no other.</p><p>The Duchess of Cambridge's sister welcomed first child Arthur in October last year, but was<a href=#> pictured looked lean in a white bikini in January, just weeks after the birth.</a></p><p>It’s no wonder that Pippa looks trim, as the fitness fanatic regularly <a href=#>works out doing sports from boxing and indoor climbing to jumping on a trampoline.</a></p><h2>Princess Diana</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000000902565.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000001105019-e1553092974816.jpg><p>Princess Diana was a firm fan of spending quality time with her boys, and took them on a number of family holidays to far-flung beach resorts.</p><p>The royal was snapped looking care-free on a break to the Caribbean in 1993, wearing a red bikini and sunglasses in the sea.</p><p>In another shot during earlier years of her marriage to Prince Charles, she was spotted posing on a yacht in Majorca wearing an eye-catching strapless floral two-piece.</p><h2>Lady Amelia Windsor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000424335838.jpg><p>Last year, Lady Amelia Windsor threw the royal rulebook out the window and caused a furore after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">going topless on the beach in Ibiza.</a></p><p>The 23-year-old model, who is 38th in line to the throne, strolled around Santa Eulalia wearing just pink bikini bottoms.</p><p>She also looked happy and relaxed as she read a book and cooled off with a dip in the sea.</p><p>The Duke of Kent’s Granddaughter, who has been named the most beautiful royal by Tatler, was on holiday with her sister Marina.</p><h2>The Queen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000477301986.jpg><p>You’ll be hard-pressed to find snaps of Her Majesty stretched out on a beach in a swimsuit.</p><p>But the monarch was pictured in 1953 having a swimming lesson when she was about 27-years-old.</p><p>Donning a fetching swimming cap instead of her usual colourful trademark hats, the young royal splashed around in the water with sister Princess Margaret.<br></p><h2>Prince Philip</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000477315206.jpg><p>Back in the day, Prince Phillip is known to have had a reputation for being a bit of a dish.</p><p>And a black-and-white image shows off his chiselled torso in Turkey in 1951.</p><p>The royal would have been around 30-years-old at the time and the snap was captured when he was with the royal navy aboard the HMS Magpie.</p><p>Like his grandson Prince Harry, Prince Philip was a fan of water sports, and is said to have done water skiing during the trip.<br></p><h2>Princess Margaret</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000477301991.jpg><p>The Queen’s sister was captured taking a dip in a lake in Windsor at Sunninghill Park in Windsor.</p><p>The royal rebel looked incredible in a fetching one-piece and swimming hat, as she made the most of her UK summer in 1964.<br></p><h2>Princess Beatrice</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000477320086.jpg><p>Princess Beatrice and her sister Eugenie have come under fire in the past for their jet-setting lifestyles, despite not being working royals.</p><p>One of their many lavish getaways included a yacht break in St Tropez, where Beatrice was snapped in a polka dot halter-neck bikini.</p><p>Making the most of her down-time the royal smiled in the sun with pals.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading
