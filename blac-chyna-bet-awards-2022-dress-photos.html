She wore a dramatic eye makeup look to offset the light hair and had a gold shimmer to her lips that matched the dress. Chyna was solo as she took her red carpet pictures before heading inside to the event.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>This red carpet appearance comes just days after Chyna reached a settlement with her ex<strong>, Rob Kardashian</strong>, in their revenge porn case. The two were set to face off in a trial, but were able to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reach a settlement</a> before jury selection began. The specific details of their settlement have not been publicized.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blac-chyna-BET-Awards-2022-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Chyna sued Rob for posting “revenge porn” photos of her on social media in 2017 when they were going through a public feud after their breakup. Just days before the trial was set to begin earlier this month, Chyna was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>eager to face off</a> against her ex in court, so it’s unclear why she eventually decided to settle.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Meanwhile, Chyna also recently lost a defamation lawsuit against Rob and some of his family members. She claimed that the KarJenner family members were behind the decision to “deliberately” cancel Rob & Chyna&nbsp;after just one season on E!. The Kardashian family won the $100 million lawsuit, which also stemmed from Rob and Chyna’s 2017 breakup. The exes have one five-year-old daughter,&nbsp;<strong>Dream Kardashian</strong>, together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5FvZpukkZh6pLTYp5hmmpWpeqLDwKubrGViZX9zecOrnKyrXaW1sMDOrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./douglas-mcgrath-passed-away-at-the-age-of-64.html><span>←</span><span>Douglas McGrath Passed Away At The Age Of 64</span></a>
