We met when we were 12 years old at the seaside in Croatia," she said (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>via the New York Post</a>).

Shortly after, she signed with the agency <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Immortal Models Management</a> and has <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>appeared in several campaigns</a> for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>Slovenian jeweler Zlatarna Celje</a>, as well as on the cover of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5>Cosmopolitan Slovenia</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the past, Goltes announced the launch of her fashion blog in October 2021 and teased the idea of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>designing a workout clothing line</a> in July 2020, though there have been no additional updates on the projects. Most recently, Goltes shared a rare look at how she chooses an outfit in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>TikTok</a> posted in February 2022.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Goltes previously told Cosmopolitan SI that focusing on her identity and goals was crucial to making her relationship with Doncic work, in part so that she doesn't lose her sense of self. She shared her belief that when a person can be happy alone, it can make them a better friend and partner.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-doncic-live-together-in-dallas></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She and Doncic live together in Dallas</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Anamaria Goltes Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Doncic and Goltes live together in Dallas, and while she enjoys the city now, it took some getting used to it after moving from Slovenia. She explained to Cosmopolitan SI that she was exposed to a new place with a new culture and it prompted a new way of thinking. Some of the adjustments she had to make included finding the best local grocery stores, picking a gym and making new friends.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The following year, Goltes gave a heartfelt update about the transition. "Dallas is a lot like Europe,” she shared in an Instagram Story Q&A. “I love Dallas. It reminds me of home.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Goltes said that relocating to a new continent helped her grow as a person and gave her a new perspective — and that positively impacted her relationship with Doncic. She opened up about learning to enjoy her own company when Doncic was busy training a lot of the time.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-doncic-have-three-dogs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She and Doncic have three dogs</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Anamaria Goltes Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Doncic and Goltes share three dogs: a Pomeranian named Hugo, a White Swiss Shepherd named Gia and a large breed named Viki, whom they <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>welcomed into their family</a> in February 2022. Goltes said one of the silver linings of the COVID-19 pandemic was being able to spend quality time with her boyfriend and pooches.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I love that I get to spend some time with Luka, Hugo, and Gia in the quarantine," she said in an Instagram Story Q&A. "We don't get to spend that many days together because we are always working on our individual things. So being able to spend time together feels very good."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-is-doncics-biggest-cheerleader></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She is Doncic's biggest cheerleader</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Anamaria Goltes Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Goltes is often on hand to cheer for Doncic at games and events, where she's spotted <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wearing his jersey number</a>, 77. And even when she can't attend matchups, Goltes still represents him at home with their dogs and their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>coordinating blue-and-white uniforms</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the 2023 All-Star game, she stepped out in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>a custom denim jacket</a> with his name and number on the back. Beyond the basketball court, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Goltes walked the NBA Awards red carpet</a> with Doncic in 2019 when he was named Rookie of the Year. The model wore a form-fitting black gown while Doncic opted for a sleek blue suit.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-doncic-team-up-for-charity></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She and Doncic team up for charity</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Anamaria Goltes Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Doncic and Goltes are a team in more ways than one. When Doncic's basketball schedule prohibited him from visiting two Slovenian children's hospitals he'd supported with his foundation in December 2022, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Goltes attended in his place</a> with holiday-themed balloons.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a statement shared by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Cosmopolitan SI</a>, Doncic said, "I hope this puts a smile on their faces and cheers them up. They are brave and strong, so I want them to know that I am thinking of them during the holidays and that I want them to return to their homes as soon as possible."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-doncic-share-one-child></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She and Doncic share one child</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In early December 2023, Doncic and Goltes announced the arrival of their first child together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Gabriela 💕!" they captioned a photo of the newborn on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's unclear exactly what day the couple's daughter was born, but Doncic did miss the Mavericks vs. Memphis Grizzlies game in Dallas on Dec. 1.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6edvG610maYp5mdlr%2BqrYygpqWslah6rcHKmmSdp56YtqR5lm5na2lhZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./laverne-cox.html><span>←</span><span>Laverne Cox Celebrity Profile | Actress Orange Is the New Black Hollywood Life</span></a>
