Hall immediately made an impression on DelVecchio after introducing herself as a Jamaican girl living in Los Angeles when she entered the house.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While some of the other girls vying for DelVecchio’s heart were disgruntled by her quick bond with DelVecchio, Hall focused on building their relationship throughout the first season of the show. Though they ultimately broke up, she returned for season 2 in 2020, and the two <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>revealed they were dating at the reunion</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When asked about their relationship status since the show ended during the virtual reunion, Hall got up from her chair and walked out of her room — only to surprise the audience by entering DelVecchio’s room and sitting next to him. He then revealed that the two were living together.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Now we get to spend real time with each other, getting to know each other on a different type of level altogether and if you can live with someone, that’s most of the battle right there,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It just kind of happened,” Hall added.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-they-quarantined-together-in-2020></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>They quarantined together in 2020</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After season 2 of Double Shot at Love wrapped, the COVID-19 pandemic hit and the new couple <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>decided to quarantine together</a> in DelVecchio’s home. They revealed their relationship to the rest of the Jersey Shore cast in November 2020 as the crew gathered for a virtual dinner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Through this pandemic, I’m full of surprises — I grew myself, I grew a beard and I got a girlfriend,” the DJ explained in a confessional. “Nikki and I, we left Double Shot with a connection, and we rebuilt that connection on Double Shot 2.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He continued, “It’s pretty crazy how my relationship has grown. This whole quarantine thing has been a blessing and a curse.
