Some fans went as far as to suggest a crossover between the two.

The film is controversial for how it divided Star Wars fans, but maybe putting the cast in a murder mystery would help alleviate some of the divides.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This 'Knives Out 3' cast includes a more wholesome addition.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Knives Out 3 where it’s Benoit Blanc and Paddington Bear trying to find out who stole the world’s supply of marmalade</p>— Braddington (12-0) (@bradwhipple) <a href=#>November 24, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>By far the most cuddly suggestion on the list, who wouldn't love to see Benoit Blanc solving mysteries with Paddington Bear?! There was a social media trend of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">editing Paddington Bear into other movies</a>, but Knives Out 3 could have the best of both worlds with Paddington already the main character.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Would this 'Knives Out 3' count as the Darkest Timeline?

The media circus surrounding the flick, which ultimately ended in one celebrity breakup and one incident known as <a href=#>#SpitGate</a>, might create a compelling setting for a murder mystery.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">More Ethan Hawke for 'Knives Out 3.'</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>i think ethan hawke should be in knives out 3 but he should be a cameo again for no other reason than it would just be funny</p>— Kil (@hawkewatching) <a href=#>November 27, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Who doesn't need more Ethan Hawke in their lives? Although he did not appear as a cameo in Knives Out, he did (mild spoiler alert) cameo in Glass Onion. One fan suggests Rian Johnson make a tradition out of Ethan Hawke cameos in his future films simply for the fun of it.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Someone even has the perfect setting in mind for 'Knives Out 3.'</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Knives Out 3, but it's set at a convention for an obscure old sci-fi show</p><p>starring Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy, and Paul McGann</p>— Carrie // Dr. Bones' #2 Stan (@soundsmythprod) <a href=#>November 27, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>One Twitter user suggests not only a core cast but a setting for Knives Out 3.
