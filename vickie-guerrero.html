Her full name is <strong>Vickie Lynn Lara,</strong> but now she goes by <strong>Vickie Benson.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Likewise, she is American by nationality, while her ethnic background is mixed, i.e., French and Mexican.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Young-Vicky-Guerrero.jpg><p>Talking about her parents, there are absolutely no details about them as their names and whereabouts are unknown. The same is the case with her siblings as well.</p><p>As for her education, Vickie graduated from Herzing University with a medical degree.</p><h2><span>Personal Life And Affair | Did Edge Marry Vickie Guerrero? And Who Is Her Husband?</span></h2><p>As we all know, Vickie got a kickstart in the WWE community thanks to her husband, Eddie Guerrero, who also was a professional wrestler.</p><p>Likewise, Eddie and Vickie tied the knot in 1990 after dating for three whole years.</p><p>They have two daughters named <strong>Shaul Marie Guerrero</strong>, born in 1990, and <strong>Sherilyn Amber Guerrero</strong>, born in 1995.&nbsp;</p><p>With that, Vickie acted as stepmother to <strong>Kaylie</strong>, born in 2002. For those who don’t know, Kaylie is the daughter of her late husband, Eddie and <strong>Tara Mahoney</strong>.</p><p>The two dated when Eddie and Vickie were separated for a while.</p><p>Sadly, their marriage fell apart following the death of her former husband, Eddie.</p><p>On November 13, 2005, Eddie was found dead in the room of The Marriot Hotel in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He died from acute heart failure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vickie-002.jpg><p>After her husband’s death, Vickie did not date for a decade and focused solely on WWE.</p><p>Within a short time, she rose as a villain and was loathed by almost all the show fans. As for her marriage with the wrestler Edge, it was mainly for the show and was far from authentic.</p><p>Following her departure from the show, Vickie started dating <strong>Kris Benson</strong>. Finally, on June 18, 2015, Guerrero announced her engagement to Benson, and their marriage took place on September 12, 2015.</p><p>Also, they have no children but spend quality time with their children from previous relationships.</p><p>Not to mention, the couple has stayed away from controversies, and from the looks of it, they don’t seem to divorce anytime soon, either.</p><h2>Professional Career | WWE Debut</h2><p>Professionally talking about her WWE career, Vickie made her debut as a face of WWE with her late husband, Eddie Guerrero and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Rey Mysterio</strong></a>.</p><p>Right from the start, Vickie starts with a drama where she and Eddie’s two daughters stop Eddie from revealing Mysterio’s secret. This continued throughout the first half of 2005 until Eddie’s untimely death on November 13, 2005.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, Vickie started appearing more prominently in WWE and with more controversial storylines after this.</p><p>Not to mention, she got involved in feuds, including one between Mysterio and<strong> Chavo Guerrero</strong>. Then around October 2006, <strong>Chris Benoit</strong> became involved in the storyline.</p><p>Moreover, Benoit was more interested in figuring out what Vickie was doing with Eddie’s estate while still defending the WWE United States Championship in a rivalry with Chavo.</p><p>During the survivor series, Vickie was knocked off the ring, which led her to wear a neck brace. Following the incident, Guerrero accused Chris of “intentionally” hitting her.</p><p>In May 2007, Guerrero was given Theodore Long’s assistant position, who was the General Manager of WWE. Then during his wedding preparations, Guerrero started acting as interim general manager of SmackDown!</p><p>Following the heart attack of Long, on 21st September 2007,&nbsp; Guerrero was announced as the new General Manager of SmackDown by <strong>Vince McMahon</strong>.</p><p>After that, Vickie’s career had many ups and downs, from her romantic relationship with Edge to getting Tombstone Piledriver performed by Undertaker on Vickie.</p><p>The next time we saw her was on December 14, and she was in a wheelchair. After her return, Guerrero made partial matches to help Edge win the World Heavyweight Championship at Armageddon.</p><h3>Formation Of La Familia And Drama</h3><p>Also, in early 2008, she formed La Familia with her nephew Chavo, Edge, the team of <a href=# rel=noopener>Curt Hawkins</a> and <strong>Zack Ryder</strong>, and even <strong>Bam Neely</strong>.</p><p>As a part of the group, Vickie helped Chavo win the ECQ Championship from <strong>CM Punk</strong>.</p><p>After that, she kept on interfering with more events and matches.</p><p>Not to mention, Guerrero also created a feud and numerous opportunities for Edge to reclaim his lost title.</p><p>Edge called off the wedding after many internal dramas after losing the World Heavyweight Championship to CM Punk, only to patch things up the next week.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vickie-003.jpg><p>Then things started to go downhill when<strong> Triple H</strong> exposed Edge for cheating on Vickie with their wedding planner, <strong>Alicia Fox</strong>. Following this, Edge asked for forgiveness, only to get a match fixed against his arch-enemy, The Undertaker.</p><p>However, during the Survivor Series, Vickie and Edge patched things up and even won a Slammy Award for the Couple of the Year.</p><p>In February 2009, Vickie became the interim General Manager of Raw following the absence of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Stephanie McMahon</strong></a>.</p><p>Despite her effort, <a href=# rel=noopener>John Cena</a> claimed the World Heavyweight title from Edge, and Vickie moved to Raw to become a General Manager.</p><h2>Move To Raw And Departure (2009-2014) | Is Vickie Guerrero In The Hall Of Fame?</h2><p>Early 2009 proved a lot for Vickie to take in, from her resignation as Raw’s general manager to parting ways with Edge.</p><p>After succumbing to a mental breakdown, Vickie returned to SmackDown during their 10th Anniversary special episode.</p><p>Drastically in a new look, Guerrero was accompanied by her storyline boyfriend, <strong>Eric Escobar.</strong> Upon her return, Vince McMahon named her as the SmackDown consultant.</p><p>Vickie is not someone new when it comes to conflict and arguments. Similarly, she got involved in a heated rivalry between WWE Women’s Champion Mickie James and Michelle McCool and Layla this time.</p><p>Thankfully to many fans, Vickie departed from the WWE world, at least from an on-screen appearance in late 2014.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Guerrero made few appearances after she departed from the show, mostly comprising her roles as a villain.</p><p>But it is safe to say that none of her returns were joyous or victorious. And sadly, even after being part of WWE for a decade, she is not in the Hall of Fame.</p><p><strong>You Might Also Be Interested In Reading <a href=# rel=noopener>Big Boss Man Bio: Personal life, Wrestling Career & Death.>></a></strong></p><h2>How Old Is Vickie Guerrero? | Age And Body Measurements</h2><p>The infamous Vickie is now 55 years old, which means she was born on April 16, 1968.</p><p>And also, her star sign happens to be Aries.

Since she is already in her 50s, Vickie is a bit curvy but dresses in tight and fitting clothes.</p><h2>Vickie Guerrero | When The Rock Sang To Vickie</h2><p>Yes, you heard it right. The Rock, aka Dwayne Johnson, sang to Vickie Guerrero on a 2013 edition of WWE Monday Night RAW. It was a modified version of Eric Clapton’s Original Song – Wonderful Tonight.</p><p></p><p>The song was not the nicest thing ever and might have been hurtful to Vickie. She looked furious when the Rock finished his singing.&nbsp;</p><h2>What Is Vickie Guerrero Worth? | Net Worth And Salary</h2><p>Formerly the General Manager of Raw and SmackDown, Vickie Guerrero earned a lot of wealth and fame, no matter how negative it was during her time.</p><p>As of 2023, Vikcie Guerrero has a net worth of <strong>$8 million</strong>. Notoriously known for her unfair match-fixing and biasedness, Guerrero did make a career out of it.</p><p>However, even today, she has not revealed much regarding her income and assets. Hence, we are not sure how much wealth she possesses now.</p><p><strong>Get To Know <a href=#>Top 12 Female Professional Wrestlers In WWE>></a></strong></p><h2>Interview For Pro Wrestling Illustrated</h2><p>Wrestling fans deserve something special, according to Vickie Guerrero.</p><p>In an interview with Candace Cordelia for Pro Wrestling Illustrated, Vickie Guerrero discussed the most common misconception about wrestling management.</p><p>Many individuals, according to Vickie, could believe that a manager doesn’t play a crucial function, but that isn’t the case at all, she says.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think many people view a manager as unimportant in the match. Of course, in my opinion and my experience, the wrestling superstar, is what everyone is there to see. If I can have a little bit of element on the side to entertain the crowd, to cheat, to interfere, and to highlight the wrestler in that match,”</p><p>Vickie explained, “that’s something that I want the crowd to enjoy. That’s something that I want the crowd to remember, even though we’re on the floor and we’re running around the ring and going to spots or whatever it is, we’re a part of that, we’re an extension of that entertainment for the crowd.”</p><h2>2022 Update</h2><p>At AEW Full Gear 2022, Vickie Guerrero honored the late Eddie Guerrero.</p><p>The late Eddie Guerrero was remembered during Saturday night’s AEW Full Gear 2022 pay-per-view event.</p><p>Eddie died from severe heart failure at age 38, exactly 18 years ago this month.</p><p>His widow Vickie attended Nyla Rose’s AEW TBS Title match against Champion Jade Cargill at Full Gear 2022.</p><p>Vickie was wearing an “I’m your Mami” shirt as a homage to Guerrero’s 2005 “I’m your Papi” shirt as the two drove to the ring in a low-rider.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>Vickie has a podcast.</li><li>Because of her connection to AEW, WWE decided to forbid her from featuring any of their superstars on her podcast.</li><li>She is related to Aiden English.</li><li>She’s a professional wrestling personality and director known for One Dave at a time( 2020), WWE Monday Night RAW( 1993), and WWE stars( 2009).</li><li>n 2019, she graduated with a Bachelorette of Science in healthcare administration from Herzing University.</li><li>Vickie Guerrero is one of the most despised female wrestlers in history, receiving loud jeers from the crowd no matter what she performs.</li></ul><h2>Search Graph</h2><p>The trend graph of Vickie is at its maximum dynamic peak and shows how much people search for her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Vickie-Guerrero.jpg><p>In all her public appearances and podcast, she connects directly to the audience, all of which are the factors that help her with her popularity.</p><h2>Vicky Guerrero | Social Media Presence</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>–&nbsp; 760 K Followers</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>–&nbsp; 273 K Followers</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I always get the last laugh!!! <a href=#>#excuseme</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/WuJG3IkFrq</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8ZD5ISW9F9</a></p><p>— Vickie Guerrero (@VickieGuerrero) <a href=#>November 20, 2020</a></p><h2>Common Queries About Vicky Guerrero</h2><h3>Did Edge really marry Vickie Guerrero?</h3><p>The marriage between Edge and Vickie Guerrero had no authenticity.
