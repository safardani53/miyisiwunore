"No arrest made."</p><p>"No Bravo suspension," she continues. "No worries."</p><p>She then promises fans: "We’ll keep you posted."</p><p>That is very interesting … considering that two of those claims are in conflict with reports.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>TMZ‘s report, which we are inclined to believe, says that Darby has been charged with felony assault.</p><p>(He has also been charged with misdemeanor improper sexual contact)</p><p>He has also been suspended by Truly Original, the production company behind The Real Housewives of Potomac.</p><p>And he has been suspended by Bravo, who say that they have procedures to follow when allegations of this nature are made.</p><p>It is curious that Ashley would make an announcement that is contrary to what we’ve heard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>As you may recall, these allegations — reported to police within days of the October 1 incident — were made by a cameraman, Orville Palmer.</p><p>According to his accusation, Michael Darby began by giving him what he perceived to be a flirtatious look.</p><p>On its own, that’s a pretty subjective perception, and almost never a crime.</p><p>He says that Darby then grabbed and groped his butt.</p><p>He says that he put down the camera and demanded that Darby stop touching his butt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>There was another alleged incident, days before, in which Michael Darby is said to have kicked him in the butt.</p><p>Kicking someone’s butt is not necessarily sexual in nature, but consider this:</p><p>One: you should not be touching anyone’s posterior without permission.</p><p>Two: kicking a butt might not be inherently sexual, but it’s inherently assault. Stop it.</p><p>As we mentioned, Palmer filed charges just days after the October 1 incident.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Some may feel a surge of anger towards Ashley for standing by her husband when these allegations have been made.</p><p>We should remember that blame for misdeeds — alleged or proven — should not be misplaced to a person’s family or loved ones.</p><p>Ashley, like so many people who are close to those who are accused of predatory behavior, is struggling to reconcile the man she knows with what she has now heard.</p><p>She may believe that this is over a vendetta against her husband, or somehow a ploy to make money.</p><p>Be angry with her for her claims that are contrary to reports, if you like, but not every wife is likely to file for divorce when allegations surface.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>What makes this story a little complicated is that this alleged sexual assault case is that this is a married man who is accused of groping another man.</p><p>Obviously, not all sex crimes are about attraction, but a lot of people find that surprising and even difficult to accept.</p><p>There have been other famous man-on-man assault stories. The most famous among them are probably Brendan Fraiser <a href=#>and Terry Crews</a>.</p><p>No one has the right to touch another person without their consent.</p><p>It is neither "gay" nor "homophobic" to report a sexual assault committed by one man upon another. Crimes are crimes.</p><a href=#><img width=1706 height=2560 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/weinstein-scandal-which-powerful-men-are-accused-of-sexual-misco-scaled.jpg alt="Hollywood Sex Scandal: Who's Been Caught?
