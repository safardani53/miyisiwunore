The reality is that it may have caused ructions with people that have been believing some of the stuff that Harry has been putting out.</p><p>"It’s a book about the King… It’s really a proper biography of the King."</p><p>Here's a rundown of nine of the biggest reveals in the book.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="read more in Celebrity">read more in Celebrity</h2><h3>Harry's behaviour after the Queen's death shocked Royals</h3><p>At the top of the list is the book's claim that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince Harry</a> made demands just hours before the Queen's death - which shocked royals.</p><p>Harry had been in the UK when the Queen fell ill.</p><p>He boarded a plane and flew north alone to be at her bedside at Balmoral.</p><p>But she sadly passed away before he arrived and <a href=#>claims he read about her death on the BBC</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>The book claims: "Close sources said he had decided not to fly up to Scotland with his brother and uncles after a disagreement over his wife, Meghan.</p><p>"When Harry insisted that she should accompany him, it was his father who told him she couldn't come."</p><p>Harry's demands apparently did not "go down well" with the family who were left "shocked by his behaviour".</p><h3>Queen checked Sandringham Summit meeting room for 'bugs'</h3><p>One part of the book covers the so-called <a href=#>Sandringham Summit</a>, where the late Queen, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince William and Prince Charles</a> joined with Harry to discuss his and Meghan's 'Megxit' deal.</p><p>According to Jobson, the late monarch&nbsp;ordered the meeting room be&nbsp;swept for bugs in case of any recording devices which could leak details of the crucial talks to the press.</p><h3>Queen met with 'curt three-word reply' from Meghan</h3><p>The book also claims&nbsp;Meghan left the late Queen surprised with her "curt three-word" response&nbsp;after she offered some important advice.</p><p>According to Jobson, sources claim the Queen advised Meghan to spend time with&nbsp;Sophie, Countess of Wessex&nbsp;(now the Duchess of Edinburgh), for support, to which she replied, "I've got Harry".</p><p>Jobson says the Queen was "surprised" by the remark.</p><h3>William's 'drastic' strategy to handle Harry</h3><p>Jobson also examines the consequences of <a href=#>Harry and Meghan's bombshell Oprah Winfrey interview</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Oprah Winfrey</a>&nbsp;in California,&nbsp;<a href=#>Prince Harry</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Meghan Markle</a>&nbsp;blasted “racist” Britain, the&nbsp;<a href=#>Royal Family</a>&nbsp;and the press, while highlighting Meghan’s mental health struggles.</p><p>According to Jobson, the tell-all chat shattered trust between Harry and his father and brother, which led to William employing a drastic new tactic to deal with the couple.</p><p>Jobson writes: "What concerned both Charles and his eldest son was Harry's total lack of discretion; neither felt they could fully trust him again and they decided not to meet him alone in future."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2018-widnes-england-meghan-markle-746881997.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/next-steps-decided-source-told-553441946.jpg><h3>High-level discussions debated the future of Harry and Meghan's titles</h3><p>The book also claims Harry and Meghan having their Sussex titles stripped was "discussed at the highest level".</p><p>However, Jobson adds: "The King is said not to be in favour of it, but other senior royals are less indulgent. Only time will tell."</p><p>It comes after an<a href=#> exclusive Sun poll revealed the British public thinks </a>Harry should be stripped of his titles for “embarrassing” and “exploiting” the Royal Family.</p><h3>Harry's outbursts 'wearied' the Queen</h3><p>Tense exchanges between Harry and his brother were said to have puzzled the Queen, the book claims, with the late-monarch thinking he and Meghan were "quite mad".</p><p>In the book, Jobson claims the Queen was "tired" after listening to the Sussexes blasting the monarchy.</p><p>In his interview on TalkTV, Jobson discussed Meghan's influence on Harry.</p><p>He said: “I think the Queen felt, from what I understand from people close to them, that his judgement was -&nbsp; he was so much in love with Meghan… that effectively it was clouding his judgement. That’s what Her Majesty thought."</p><h3>Explosive row on money led to Harry swearing at King Charles</h3><p>Next up is the claim that&nbsp;Harry allegedly swore at his father King Charles during an explosive row over money.</p><p>Jobson reveals: "Prince Charles simply stopped taking Harry's calls after his son swore at him and repeatedly asked for funds.</p><p>"When the Queen asked Charles why he hadn't given in, he told her that he wasn't a bank."</p><h3>Kate's real feelings on a walkabout with Harry and Meghan</h3><p>In the part of the book which charts the aftermath of the Queen's death, Jobson addresses <a href=#>Harry and Meghan unexpectedly joining William and Kate </a>for a Windsor walkabout.</p><p>Kate was said to have found a walkabout with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry one of the "hardest things she's ever done".</p><p>In the days after the&nbsp;<a href=#>Queen</a>'s death, the "fab four" appeared to put their differences aside as they stepped out of a car at&nbsp;<a href=#>Windsor Castle</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>spoke to mourners</a>.</p><p>Jobson writes in Our King that the display of togetherness was merely an "illusion", and that she "later admitted to a senior royal that such was the ill feeling between the two couples, the joint walkabout was one of the hardest things she'd ever had to do".</p><h3>Staff joked Harry was Meghan's hostage</h3><p>One of the most sensational claims in the book is that&nbsp;royal insiders described Harry as "Meghan’s hostage".</p><p>Palace insiders reportedly joked about&nbsp;<a href=#>Harry</a>&nbsp;being a "hostage" of wife&nbsp;<a href=#>Meghan Markle</a>&nbsp;and blamed her for the family's "fallout".</p><p>Aides also claimed he was a "victim of Stockholm syndrome", Jobson writes.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>The book reveals some senior officials believed Harry should be stripped of his Duke of Sussex title after&nbsp;<a href=#>Megxit</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2020-prince-harry-first-time-553902484.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/prince-harry-meghan-duke-duchess-552876596.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FrZ2lxZmiDcK7OppmsoJWhubR50Z6tnpmcmrFuvs6ymKVlkqS8rHnQrpyepl2isqi0wKdm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michaele-salahi-nude-in-playboy-actually-coming-soon.html><span>←</span><span>Michaele Salahi Nude in Playboy: Actually Coming Soon!</span></a>
