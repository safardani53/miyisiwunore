he won't be leaving that fortune to his son.</strong></p><p>The popular anchor - who <a href=#>served as guest host of Jeopardy!</a> in April of 2021 - is worth a pretty penny, but claims he only received $1-2million out of his mother’s estate upon her passing.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000648460381-1.jpg><h2>Who is Anderson Cooper?</h2><p><a href=#>Anderson Cooper</a>, 54, is a journalist and one of the top anchors at CNN.</p><p>He hosts Anderson Cooper 360° while serving as a correspondent for 60 Minutes on CBS.</p><p>Cooper also served as host of his own syndicated daytime talk show, Anderson Live, from 2011-2013.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000498354004.jpg><h2>What is his net worth?</h2><p>Cooper is one of CNN’s most recognized faces whose salary is believed to be $12million annually.&nbsp;</p><p>His net worth is estimated to be $50million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><p>Additionally, Cooper was the heir to his mother <a href=#>Gloria Vanderbilt</a>’s fortune and received all of her property when she passed.</p><p>However, it is unclear what the monetary inheritance was exactly, as he claims his mother never left him a trust fund.&nbsp;</p><p>"My mom's made clear to me that there's no trust fund," Cooper told Howard Stern in a radio interview <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">first reported by Business Insider</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"There's none of that," he added.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000580249857.jpg><h2><strong>Why isn't Cooper leaving an inheritance to son Wyatt?</strong></h2><p>Cooper does not intend to leave his son Wyatt with an inheritance, he told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Business Insider</a>.</p><p>Although Cooper reportedly makes $12million from his role at the news station alone, he said he doesn't believe in passing on money.</p><p>Growing up, Cooper said he didn't believe he would have been as motivated to succeed in his career and in life if he knew there was an inheritance waiting for him.</p><p>He wants his son to work for everything he earns, and this mindset is passed down from his mom, Gloria Vanderbilt.</p><p>She had told Cooper from an early age that she would pay for college, but after that he was on his own.</p><p>The same mentality is being passed down to Wyatt, as Cooper said he will take the same course.</p><p>"I think its a curse," he said on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Howard Stern show</a> in 2014.</p><p>"From the time I was growing up, if I felt like there was some pot of gold waiting for me, I don't know if I would have been so motivated."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

started out in 2001 on CNN after the September 11 attacks in New York.</p><p>In 2002 he became CNN's weekend prime-time anchor and has since hosted CNN's New Year's Eve special from Times Square.</p><p>In 2003 he became the anchor of Anderson Cooper 360° and four years later joined CBS for 60 minutes.</p><h2>Who is his mom Gloria Vanderbilt?</h2><p>Vanderbilt was a fashion designer and the only child of railroad heir Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt.</p><p>She became one of the early pioneers of the blue jeans design while also launching dresses, perfumes, blouses and other accessories.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

married four times and had four children: Leopold Stanislaus "Stan" Stokowski, Christopher Stokowski, Carter Vanderbilt, and Anderson Cooper.&nbsp;</p><p>Cooper along with his brother Carter came from her last marriage with Wyatt Emory Cooper.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

medication and committed suicide from the family’s 14th floor apartment when he was 23.&nbsp;</p><p>Before her passing in June 2019, Vanderbilt and Cooper released a memoir together titled The Rainbow Comes and Goes: A Mother and Son On Life, Love, and Loss.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in US News</h2></p><p>He said: "He is named after my father, who died when I was
