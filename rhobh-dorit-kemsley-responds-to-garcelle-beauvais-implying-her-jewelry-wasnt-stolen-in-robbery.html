Dorit allegedly told the three male intruders who were armed with guns, “Don’t hurt my babies. Don’t kill me. I’m a mother,” as she begged for her life. Dorit confirmed in an Instagram post after the terrifying incident that she and her kids <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>weren’t harmed</a> during the robbery. One year after the incident, Dorit exclusively told&nbsp;<strong>Hollywood Life&nbsp;</strong>at BravoCon 2022 that she was still in <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“intense therapy.”</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>On an earlier episode of&nbsp;RHOBH&nbsp;this season, Dorit revealed that <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>$10,000 in cash was stolen</a> out of her purse at the grocery store. “I had my handbag in the shopping cart. When I got to the register, I realized that my handbag was gone,” she said. “The police reviewed the video surveillance. They discovered that I was followed by three men. That threw me right back into the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>throes of PTSD</a>.” Dorit has also been open about how the home robbery affected <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her marriage</a> to husband <strong>PK Kemsley</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze49wZqugn5e1brDOq6CtZZuaurS4xLJkq52jpbyvsNJmq6hll5a%2FpLHLpZxmmpWWwretyKxkoqWgocaqusZmn56qXZ%2ByuLHLq7Bmr5Gou7V50q2mpZ2eYravedGomZudoq58</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-charlie-walk-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Charlie Walk Dating Now</span></a>
