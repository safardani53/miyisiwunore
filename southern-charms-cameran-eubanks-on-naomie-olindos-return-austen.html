Now, however, <a href=#>Naomie is set to return for season 8</a> of the show, which Cameran exclusively told Us Weekly wasn’t that big of a surprise.</p><p>“I think Naomie has been through a lot in her life and it felt like a good time to come back for her for whatever reason,” Cameran told Us earlier this month while promoting <a href=#>her new collaboration with Tuckernuck</a>. “I don’t know. I mean, we’ll see what happens.”</p><p>The <a href=#>real estate agent</a>, who has been friends with Naomie’s ex-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Craig Conover</strong></a> for years, noted that it “might be awkward” for the former flames to be back on the show together <a href=#>after their 2017 breakup</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Cameran-Eubanks-Sounds-Off-Naomie-Southern-Charm-Return-Austen-Drama-0001.jpg><p>Craig, 33, has since moved on with <a href=#>Winter House</a> costar <a href=#><strong>Paige DeSorbo</strong></a>, while Naomie broke up with her boyfriend of three years, <a href=#><strong>Metul Shah</strong></a>, in summer 2021.</p><p>“I’m not sure if he was dating Paige yet when they started filming or not,” Cameran said, pointing out that the new romance <a href=#>could cause tension on screen</a>.</p><p>The <a href=#>Real World: San Diego</a> alum — who shares <a href=#>4-year-old daughter Palmer</a> with husband <a href=#><strong>Jason Wimberly</strong></a> — revealed that while she hasn’t met Paige, 29, yet, she has kept in touch with Craig since her reality TV departure.</p><p>“He seems super happy,” she told Us, adding, “I follow her on social media and she seems so precious and genuine. I think he’s got it right this time. I think they’re the real deal.”</p><p>When it comes to <a href=#>former castmate Austen</a>, 34, however, Cameran is aware of his recent <a href=#>Summer House</a> shenanigans.</p><p>The Anderson, South Carolina, native confessed to Us that she didn’t watch Austen’s season 6 love triangle with <a href=#><strong>Lindsay Hubbard</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Ciara Miller</strong></a> unfold, but she does follow everyone on social media so she feels like she’s in the know.</p><p>“Austen has some pull on women. I don’t know,” Cameran said, referring to <a href=#>Austen’s drama with Lindsay, 35, and Ciara, 26</a>, who got into a fight over him in the Hamptons while filming last summer. “I mean, I’ll give it to the guy, he’s tall. He smells good. I don’t know what it is, but yeah, <a href=#>women love Austen</a>.”</p><p>The <a href=#>One Day You’ll Thank Me author</a> added: “He’s never had a problem [getting a girl]. And they’re both gorgeous. Oh, my God, like, Ciara looks like a supermodel.”</p><p>In addition to keeping up with <a href=#>her Charleston buddies</a>, Cameran has recently teamed up with Tuckernuck to launch a new women’s collection <a href=#>exclusively on TNuck.com</a>.</p><p>“I have always been a genuine, longtime fan of Tuckernuck. I have been shopping on their site for years,” Cameran told Us. “So when they approached me to do a collaboration — first of all — I was just so flattered. It was just a no-brainer for me to do it.”</p><p>When it comes to her favorite pieces from the collection, <a href=#>which launches April 27</a>, the mother of one revealed she loves “everything,” especially the items with bold colors.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I wear a lot of color. It makes me feel good. I would say the pieces are all happy pieces,” she added. “They’re bright, they’re fun. They are very versatile. … They’re kind of an ode to Charleston.”</p><p>With reporting by Christian Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasp6Wptaa%2BzWaaoZmiosBur8CmnKuZnmKytq7Ap6KsZZ%2Bjeq%2BtzqagnmWfobavsM6sZKudpKq%2Fr3nArqqtnZ5k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicki-minaj-explains-ken-ehrlich-feud-grammys-producer-queen-radio.html><span>←</span><span>Nicki Minaj Explains Ken Erlich Feud Amid Grammys Drama On Queen Radio Hollywood Life</span></a>
