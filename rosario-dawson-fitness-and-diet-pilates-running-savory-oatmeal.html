While the <a href=# rel=noopener>slim and toned</a> 39-year-old says she “used to run a lot,” she stopped focusing on the cardio activity as her main workout. “I only really ever did that when I had a role coming up, because it’s so intense,” she admits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Rosario-Dawson-Health-Tips-Workout-Tips-Oatmeal-02.jpg><p>Now, the Luke Cage star gravitates towards yoga and Pilates, and she credits the latter discipline for truly transforming the muscles in her body. “That’s the one that got my shoulders back, that dancer’s <a href=# data-link=1>posture</a> kind of thing. So I’m really obsessed with that,” she says. In fact, one of her New Year’s resolutions “is to really schedule that into my week as much as I possibly can,” she notes. “That’s the one thing I do that really shows a difference.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Dawson, who recently <a href=# rel=noopener>teamed up with Quaker</a>, also concentrates on eating a healthy, balanced diet. And while she says she’s always loved oatmeal, she’s discovered new ways to consume it. “I’ve learned how much I love it in savory kind of ways — where you can have it with soy sauce and Sriracha,” says the star, explaining she’ll also add seaweed to the protein- and fiber-packed grain. “Basically, anything you can do with a quinoa or a rice bowl, you can do with an oatmeal bowl.”</p><p>The rest of the New York City native’s fitness and health routine consists of intuitive, consistent lifestyle habits. “I walk everywhere. I drink a lot of water. I try to get as much sleep as possible,” she tells Us. “Everything else about my schedule and routine is inconsistent, so if those types of things I can do, they’re really important… I can always take the stairs rather than use the elevator or the escalator.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGarp6OWv6q7jJ2YsKufo3qntdOnnKyrXZa7pXnDopytZaCeuaLAxKxkq62eo7avs4ysmK%2Bnoq56sK3TppyapF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./strictly-bake-off-christmas-tv-guide-2022.html><span>←</span><span>From Strictly to Bake Off and First Dates - here is your full Christmas TV guide</span></a>
